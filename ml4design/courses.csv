"1","1","By 'Maletsie J M",5,"Dec 30, 2016","I enjoyed every minute of this course and I have learnt so much. Thank you Coursera for this opportunity. I'll definitely recommend this course to my friends and colleagues.",173,"chem"
"2","2","By Silvia C T",5,"Feb 13, 2018","Amazing, it was a complete review of the first 2 years of college, with teacher who made it easy and as fun as it can be",121,"chem"
"3","3","By Fred H",2,"Apr 06, 2018","By far the worst of the many Coursera courses I have taken.  The slides, lecture notes, spoken lectures and quizzes are all riddled with confusing errors that make learning a painful chore.  That said, the material covered is reasonably comprehensive, so it is still possible to learn something, but only with considerable struggle.  If the numerous errata were corrected and the lectures re-recorded, this could be a good course.",430,"chem"
"4","4","By Jeanine K",5,"Jul 31, 2017","This class was really hard! I am studying to pass the chemistry endorsement test for teachers and I have not had a lot of inorganic chemistry. This class was great and introduced me to a lot of the concepts I will need to know. This class does involve a lot of math and dimensional analysis. I would not recommend it to someone new to chemistry. I would not recommend it to someone curious about chemistry. You need to be familiar with algebra and dimensional analysis and have some knowledge of basic chemistry concepts first. I have completed General and Organic Chemistry but it was many years ago and my general chemistry class was very different. This class is awesome if you need to learn some new information to add to what you already know or if you need to regain some rusty chemistry skills!For me, week 1, 2 and 7 were pretty difficult. Weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6 were much easier for me but that could be because I have some basic chemistry knowledge already.",965,"chem"
"5","5","By Tiziana B",5,"Mar 19, 2016","I have never been good at math nor chemistry but the professor explains the various processes in such a simplistic way that so far I passed the quizzes with a perfect score and I have a pretty good grasp of everything she's saying. Granted, I had to watch some explanations more than once but that's just my pace of learning. I'm thankful for this online course and waiting for the certification to become available!",416,"chem"
"6","6","By Nathan D",5,"Aug 16, 2017","I took this course because I wanted to take AP chem at my high school, but needed preparation as i had not taken a chem course previously. This covers almost the same topics as are taught at my school chem class, and I believe it has prepared me well.",251,"chem"
"7","7","By William L",5,"Jul 24, 2016","This is a great course.  The primary feature is the number of worked and practice problems.  Instead of memorizing, one learns by doing.  Short of being in the lab, this is the next best thing.",193,"chem"
"8","8","By Tajana M",5,"Jun 21, 2017","This is a great course! Very well explained! It's managing to keep my attention on 100% and that's not an easy task for anybody. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us!",174,"chem"
"9","9","By Ema D",2,"Oct 18, 2018","Could have been more complex stuff as most of the course was A level chemistry",78,"chem"
"10","10","By Trenacye J",5,"Dec 30, 2017","I have always been super interested in chemistry and the concepts that make it into a science, but there were many things i didn't understand. The instructor of this class is very knowledgeable and has a way she presents the information is already making me go hmmm...i actually understand that. I look forward to course completion and everything that i am going to learn. I'll be taking the next steps this spring and starting a degree in biochemistry...Not so intimidated anymore. Thanks",489,"chem"
"11","11","By Herman P I",5,"Aug 07, 2017","This was a great class. The instruction is very accessible. I've never liked chemistry. I couldn't wait to take the quizzes because after watching the videos and working through the examples you really feel like you grasped the concepts. I thought I might need a textbook to supplement the videos. I've taken classes where I just didn't get enough practice to feel like I understood, but this course has plenty of well worked step-by-step problems. The professor even blows some stuff up!",489,"chem"
"12","12","By Goran H",5,"Mar 11, 2018","Since it was 40 years since I studied chemistry, it was a challange to complete the course, and required much more hours than expected (about 10-14 hours/week). But thanks to the great presentations, and study material, I actually made it! :) Thanks a lot to Dr. Allison Soult, and Dr. Kim Woodrum! I highly recommend anyone interested in chemistry to sign up for this course!",376,"chem"
"13","13","By tenzin",5,"Dec 22, 2016","I really appreciate the developers, professors, and all the staffs who have worked behind this course. It is really a wondeful introductory Chemistry course, well explained and filled with great exercises. The team who answer our doubts in discussion forum reply promptly and with great detail explaination. Thank you so much. Must for any chemistry lover or interested in it.",377,"chem"
"14","14","By Pratyusha M",5,"Jun 26, 2017","Absolutely love this course! The content is very clear, the practice problems are carefully constructed (as well as applicable and challenging) and the video demonstrations make learning chemistry fun to learn. Highly prefer this coursera course over a Chemistry course I'm taking at an actual college. I'm learning so much more from these videos.",348,"chem"
"15","15","By Job Z",5,"Jan 19, 2020","Very nice course, good balance between elementary stuff and somewhat more interesting material. Not just ""practical skills"", but also interesting insight in some elementary quantum mechanics for atomic structures and the impact on the periodic system. That insight is not just theory, but it is applied later on in the course.",327,"chem"
"16","16","By Hosam A",5,"Jan 14, 2018","As useful as it should be!Takes you from the very basics of understanding the elementary concepts to the complicated (in ease) with a very reasonable introductions.Course lectures are supplied with incomplete handouts, so you can interactively participate with your own understanding and learning.",297,"chem"
"17","17","By Jamelah M",5,"Sep 26, 2017","This course was awesome! I haven't taken general chemistry in over 15 years. This course provided thorough explanations and examples to help me relearn many important concepts that are essential to an understanding of general chemistry. I am excited about enrolling in the next course!",285,"chem"
"18","18","By Michal M",5,"Apr 03, 2019","Very good course. I'd like to thank both the lecturers and the mentors on the forum. There were a few errors in the course, but all/most have been incorporated in the errata. I can't wait to start the advanced course. Thank you once again, and hope to see more courses from this team.",284,"chem"
"19","19","By Robert W I",5,"Nov 16, 2016","I wanted to give a four-star rating because of the fact that I couldn't grasp quite a few things, but then I remembered that it was just me.

Only comments I'd make are that there are a lot of errata that would benefit from being corrected in the course lectures; invariably when I find myself confused about something I'm flip-flopping between ""is the problem on my end or is there a typo somewhere in the video""?  Also, if somehow there was a way to make some sort of hands-on content in teh course (maybe a lab simulation app?) that would make some parts a lot more engaging!",471,"chem"

Before this course I had done about half a year of spectroscopy as part of labs undergraduate chemistry at community college, and we hadn't really done any UV other than mentioning its existence.  I took this course hoping to refresh and improve my spectroscopy skills and learn UV before I transfer to University.  Sadly, I found the course to be extremely cursory at best.  Perhaps I was just looking for too much.  Maybe Manchester will offer a sequel? If so I would enrol and check it out. I also found the course to be rather understaffed in that when I tried asking some questions on the forums it took weeks for even another student to reply, much less an instructor.  In addition there seem to have been several wrong answers on the quizzes, as well as typos such as 106 instead of 10^6.  Although the staff has addressed a number of this issues I am still waiting on a correction or comment on the final quiz.  Since I paid for this course, I would like my grade to reflect what I have externally verified is a correct answer.",1065,"chem"

If you are new to Spectrometry, I do not recommend you take this course. If you already learned about spectrometry and want to take this course to brush up on the basics (like I did), do not waste your time. The saving grace of this course are lab spectra that you are given to interpret at your own pace. Great exercises! Absolutely loved them!",653,"chem"

"435","435","By Brice B",3,"May 30, 2017","The individual lectures are well-structured, clear and the lecturers put the media to good use. The course as a whole, however, is very heterogeneous. Having a separate speaker for each topic is nice because you get to attend a lecture from someone who is high specialized in the topic she is lecturing about. However, if the coordination between the speaker is not well managed it leads to a lot of heterogeneity, which, again, is the case here (different speakers don't expect the same level of prior knowledge from their students, they cover some of the same material, they don't connect what they have said to what the other speakers have said...) I would add that it is irritating to follow a course where the speakers just assume that the attendees are all Americans. Wake up! There are people from all over the world on Coursera! Moreover, I don't mind following a course on Chemicals and Health in the US but it should be clearly  stated in the info on the course.",972,"chem"

I appreciate the straightforward, simplified and accessible way the information is presented in a logical and sequential format to create a foundational understanding of the essential elements of graphic design. Weeks 3 and 4 are where it really comes together. I found these lectures of such critical importance that I saved them all. For a short term course, without the more extensive commitment of a full 16-week term one might find elsewhere, if one commits the time and effort to undertake all of the assignments, I found as much value in this course as I have in more traditional programs. It's reminded me of why I love graphic design, and although it's a basic introductory course, I was excited to undertake these exercises and do it all over again.

For personal reasons i committed a bit too much on this course, and i am glad to say that whether you feel like devoting  8 hours a week for it or 28 as i did, there is stuff for you to learn.although i  already knew pretty much 70% of the material, having the concepts reestablished by this teacher in such structured manner really helped me out.If we're to get sentimental, i can honestly say that i feel this module was the best thing i did this past month, cause through fine art i have been designing for the past 25 years, but this gave me the STRUCTURE to think of DESIGN in relevant terms.awesome.-do it!btw.,i've tried to be as honest as i can possibly be here, hope it helps. if it was crap i would say it's crap. but this one isn't. and of course it's up to you to fully exploit this wonderful possibility.",1258,"design"
"477","477","By Karena A",5,"Sep 04, 2018","This course was well thought out and clearly leads the student through the fundamentals of graphic design, creating an excellent foundation for further study. The lectures were interesting and well illustrated. The only flaw I identified was the wording of the last required exercise: Brief 4.1 I struggled to decide exactly what to do, and finally chose to use two shapes in each part of the composition, but not to limit the instances. I interpreted the directions to mean that we could use only two shapes, but that the number of instances was not limited. Other students interpreted this differently and one  student downgraded me on this point. I also had trouble reviewing the work of others for this same reason.One student even used typography and I could not review it fairly, since I did not think typographic shapes were included. In addition, that student used more than two different typographic shapes also, so if they were allowed the limit was exceeded. While most of the directions used in this course were excellent and extremely clear, this one caused some confusion. I teach EFL to Chinese students, so this will make me even more aware of my own wording of directions. Thank you.",1200,"design"

Also, the material covered seemed very basic and common sense. And I guess a lot of it is, but to discuss these basic concepts, and experiment with them is very valuable. It also made me very excited about designing. In this course, it's up to the student to decide how much they want to put into the course, and therefore how much they will get out of it. Lots of the assignments are optional. However, all (but one) exercise really helped me explore the concepts explained.  It's a clear course. It's a very basic course.

First of all, I would like this course to be more informative. All weekly videos and tasks can be watched and done in one day now. Give us more videos, more information, let's go deeper! The second thing is that peer reviews seemed ineffective to me. Yeah, on the one hand, that's a real feedback from real people who are not your parents or friends so you can be judged objectively. On the other hand, I'd want to know teacher's opinion, I mean, feedback from someone who has a great experience in design.

I may have had a bit of hiccups due to some difficulties in comprehending the requirements in some assignments, whether if I was allowed to do certain things or not, and more specifically if what I understood was right, I wished there were more elaborations in a kind (Maybe a sample of how the end results should look like : arrangements of pages & such, so students would know if they got it right and also simulate it if they weren't sure) but I managed to understand & get it done.

This course basically solved my problem as it's focus is exactly that: the foundations and principles of graphic design. The main components of image, design terminology, approaching design, experimenting and exploring the different aspects of design. I honestly though this course would be too simple but despite being about the fundamentals it provides some of the most essential knowledge you can have as a designer and it does it in a clear, non-complicated way (Thanks to Mr. Worthington's calm and clear approach).

If you are looking to learn about actually using programs, look elsewhere, but if you are looking to build a strong basis for thinking about creating images, this is a great resource.The course work and necessary time input is flexible - if you are stretched for time you can still complete this course, and if you have a lot of time you can get a lot more out of it.

You will be encouraged to use various media to create your artwork, instead of going through a boring video which expects you to copy whatever the person on the screen is doing while learning nothing about the process. I really enjoyed this and recommend it to anyone who can handle the applications on their own, and needs a good theory and background into design, creation process and similar ideas.",761,"design"

The instructions for assignments perhaps could be broken into bullet points, as sometimes they were perhaps not fully understood on the optional exercises. Some guidelines to help give more substantial or constructive feedback (beyond ""This met the assignment criteria"" or ""I liked #3"") could be helpful.I'm very glad I did this course, and I was thoroughly engrossed in the exercises.

I learned a lot, technically, by myself, having to submit assignments. Looking at the materials I made, I almost cannot believe I did it by myself. The only thing: I wish I had more time to work on it and, perhaps, if the students knew since the very beginning they will finally make use of each assignment to create a very final one, they would probably consider this when choosing objects, styles, techniques.

I used Adobe Illustrator (like the instructor) and Pages, but basic knowledge of Microsoft Powerpoint or similar is enough, as you will scan hand-drawn pictures and put them in, arrange them, then export them as PDFs.

Also the system of mandatory and optional tasks is really nice cause people can choose how deep they want to go.

This class got me doing stuff that I hadn't done in a long time, like painting with water colors.

Some students put time and effort to complete an assignment, and others, they just put anything down to get it out of the way. The same as in life, I guess.

Learning that objects and letters can trigger emotions and feelings, learning the typefaces, the colouring, the playing with shapes, was very educative and interesting for me. I have never worked in Photoshop or any other photo editor so I had to learn part of that as well. This course was A+ and I thing that with the basics now I can start exploring for more and also now I see things and surrounding with second pair of eyes.",490,"design"

The course is also remarkably well-conceived didactically: Michael has an ability to explain in a few minutes' video stuff that takes dozens of pages elsewhere. I also especially enjoyed his typographic excursion (to be honest, it gave me more that the whole course 2 about typography) and the additional video where he explains how you can expressively crop a photo.

"1713","1713","By Vanessa C",4,"Jun 18, 2019","I enjoyed the structure of the course with each week building up to the final project. Logically planned out and effective structure. Videos were clear and easy to understand. I'm happy with what I produced and the class helped me build my confidence to move onto the next course. I was able to complete my project with minimal knowledge of Photoshop.However, I'm not a huge fan of the 3 peer grades needed to average out our score as it appeared from the comments left that some users misunderstood what and how they should be grading. Requiring a higher amount of grades to even out the average or allowing some grades to be challenged and reviewed by a staff member would be helpful.",686,"design"
"1714","1714","By Dimitrios P",1,"Sep 22, 2019","This could have been a very good course, but for the idea of peer grading. It just does not work. Most people's comments are purely subjective and come from very little knowledge, skill and/or experience.  Shame!",212,"design"

Just try to learn how to use Illustrator a bit beforehand. Sucks that its peer graded- but its straightforward and if you just follow the instructions, you should be fine. Quick tip: it was not clear what you needed to do for week 2, but its basically ONLY the moodboard and colour palette. I did week 2 and 3 in week 2, and exhausted myself for no reason! I was skeptical at first but its pretty good!",553,"design"

Explained in detail with great simplicity, I loved it- note taking is also made easy!My feedback is on the assignments:The difficulty I faced was i did not know how to use Indesign (this should have been a pre-requisite)- so after my first week assignment i put in some extra hours to learn InD basics to do my second assignment- that changed the quality of my work. Second - Assignment 1 was creating mood board but the sample had full project, so I as well as couple of our batch folks (I reviewed) ended up creating whole project first week - Should have given clear instructions - That would helped us focus on Week1 work. From Week2 what do work on was very clear. Please fix this for next batch",810,"design"

"1730","1730","By Myroslav O",4,"Nov 06, 2018","Very decent and applied course.The only thing for possible improvement I can think of is the form of the requirements for the assignments. Since from the very beginning of the course you are free to choose the application idea from one of the given options, but then in the end of each week your submitted assignment has to meet some particular strict requirements (such as some fixed amounts of visual elements, buttons, etc.), maybe it makes sense to restrict options you can choose of, or to mention all the strict requirements from the very beginning of the course, because sometimes it felt like I had to intentionally complicate my application (e.g. add more visual elements that do not make much sense, but in order just to meet the required criteria set in the assignments).All in all, thanks for a great course!",820,"design"

The course is complete and well structured, everything was explained in detail and the experience of learning online was friendly and easy to understand.

The assignments are well explained and the review is well guided so that you mostly get useful peer reviews.It is nice to apply the concepts on a fun project, it makes them sink in and motivate you to work on the course.

Having peers grade your work really cheapens the entire experience and makes me wonder what I'm paying for. I would often be marked down just because my ""peer"" didn't understand the assignment criteria, or doesn't comprehend English well enough.What on earth is the point of being graded at all, when you're being assigned a mark by someone who has no idea what the assignment criteria even are?

I would have preferred a final submission to an instructor or a professional in design to get real feedback. I can only give people reviews based on my personal preferences since I have not taken courses on design theory or user interface/user experience conventions.

I also placed a comment to dispute a grade I received in an assignment, because one of the peers that review it, seemed that he didn't understand English or didn't understand the question. The response from staff was really useless, they simply said that I could resubmit my assignment to have someone else review it.

It´s a quick overview on some of the main tools that can be used for design thinking, but if you want to learn more you'll need to do your own research or buy the promoted book in the course (written by the teacher). I think it's a good introduction, but I don't think it should be a paid course or award a certificate since it's mostly a book's teaser. The assignment was also strange since it's was more a reading/writing exercise of past experiences instead of actually applying the learnt concepts. A lot could have been made here, there are many people in the forum where we could have formed groups and try to problem solve wicked things and use other students as stakeholders.

WEEK 1 - Visualization lesson.Lets look how this is implemented:Try to listen WEEK 2 Physics of innovation - and follow visually(in your head) what Jeanne is talking (for 18 minutes) :). Or WEEK 1-  ""What is design thinking. Hear from the experts."" The same issue.The language is too much academic which makes it hard to follow visually.   The authors should analyze these videos and answer the question: ""Does it work?"" Speak in front of +14-16 year old children for 20 minutes (without pictures) and see if the audience can follow it (translate every sentence into picture).If this course is designed for academic world it is probably ok.

"2042","2042","By Louis S D",5,"Nov 11, 2017","This is a wonderful course and I applaud Prof Liedtka on her teaching methodology combining structure with creativity. Each of the tools listed are really useful in expressing the design thought process in action and every one of the experts have lent their unique perspectives, which have been really helpful in outlining the idea that Design Thinking tries to convey. My only gripe if any would be the assignment rubric, which shackles the author within a very walled framework and defeats the purpose of thinking out of the box. While it offers a precious guideline for the peer to evaluate, it more or less mandates the author to stick within this and it applies some sort of unwritten pressure on the peer to rate only on those defined yardsticks, which again effectively brings down the scope for the writer of the reflection to bring in fresh approaches into their piece. Design Thinking in spirit has to involve a level of creative thinking within a structured framework, but if the structure takes precedence, then in all probability creativity would take an uncomplimentary second position. Please take this for what it is, but be sure that the course and the material have been totally outstanding, and I commend the Darden team for putting this out on Coursera.",1273,"design"

I learnt that the approach to innovation is as important than the actual ideas itself and I am amazed at how much I have changed after completing this course.

This makes the design mind map discrete per step, visibility of approach becomes distinct. Visualization approach has been followed to make the traversal of whole path end to end with less chances of disputes at later point of time; and the same provides a wider spectrum to think deeper with more features and facilities to get adopted.

"2777","2777","By Michele",4,"Sep 14, 2016","Interesting course with well-organized lectures and graphics. I enjoyed the diversity of case studies, and especially hearing about countries other than the US and organizations other than large corporations with big budgets. The practice grading of the final project was well done and illuminating. It was effective in helping me understand the grading criteria better.It would be helpful if the printouts were 1 slide per page, as on the page the type is small and difficult to read. Small, weekly assignments such as posting a reflection question in the forum could be helpful. One guest presenter spoke too quickly, so I was thankful for the transcript.It would be nice if those auditing the course could also participate in the final assignment w/ peer feedback.",767,"design"
"2778","2778","By Kamlesh N",4,"Aug 11, 2016","I am two weeks into the course and really like it. The ideas and concepts mentioned are quite profound. And hope to apply them soon enough in both my personal and professional life. One additional thing which would really like seeing in the course is use of questions just to ascertain our mastery over concepts. Something like the other course which I am taking concurrently -- Think again: How to understand arguments. Where intermediate quizzes ensures that learners are understanding what the intention is followed by 'Share your thoughts' questions to express your views and discuss specific course material with other learners. I feel this mix of quizzes and sharing really helps in learning the course.",709,"design"
"2779","2779","By Askar",4,"Oct 11, 2018","The information and skills this course teaches are very useful and valuable. What I like the most, that the course shows how different companies and managers actually used these skills with careful and precise explanation.I wish there were exercises where you can also try to use skills and knowledge you have gained throughout the course.Also I find it very distracting that Jeanne Liedtka makes those creepy sounds with her lips and tongue between her lines. To be honest, it was quite a challenge to finish the course for me, because it made very uncomfortable. Of course maybe it's just me.Thank you, team Coursera and team Darden for bringing this here!",658,"design"
"2780","2780","By Mahshid Z",4,"Sep 19, 2019","Almost anyone is sure to benefit from adopting a design thinking mindset and this course illustrates the discipline and how it works beautifully. I'd say if the concept sounds new to you, definitely enroll. However, take into consideration that it is mostly theoretical and there's only one assignment at the end of the course, which is also pear-reviewed. This means you're going to have little chance of practicing what you've learned and receiving enough and legit feedback. Having said that, the assignment and reviewing others' works was a challenging thought experiment and learning opportunity.",601,"design"
"2781","2781","By Rob K",4,"Jul 01, 2019","It was a nice overview to Design Thinking, with 3 or 4 practical and diverse examples of application. The course used a consistent framework for reference throughout. I also enjoyed the different options for learning - from video lectures, different lecturers, reading materials and final assignment. To improve, the course could have been more challenging by asking more specific questions (in the assignment) that require deeper research and critical thinking (i'm not sure I deserve a certificate at the end, but will take it!). Overall positive experience.",561,"design"
"2782","2782","By Bianca M",4,"Feb 26, 2018","I really liked the course, I just think it could dive deeper into other design tools that are used during the Design Thinking Process, instead of making use of a lot of videos explaining why Design Thinking is important. If you're watching the course is because you already consider this relevant. Show us how to work better with the whole process - a role play video would be awesome. Also, sometimes seemed that Jeanne was repeating herself too much. Other than that, great course for beginners. :)",500,"design"
"2783","2783","By Ritika S",4,"Feb 13, 2019","I think it's a good theoretical course. What would help is if one review of our work can be done by Professor herself instead of peers. I would like to get an expert feedback on my work and I am sure many think that way too. Also, that brings more credibility to course. I have taken multiple Coursera courses and this is one big flaw I found. The feedback loop between student and instructor is not being closed. I do believe this course has lot of potential and was really helpful. Thank You!",495,"design"
"2784","2784","By Robert D",4,"Oct 25, 2017","I value the teachings in this course, not just for the introduction of some tools (e.g. visualization, mind-mapping, story telling, learning launch) but the contrast outlined between challenges that are puzzles and those that are mysteries. The differences between the approaches of George and Geoff for a mystery-type problem were illuminating, especially for a Six Sigma Black Belt. I appreciated the lesson reinforcement done in the way you structured the final quiz and its assessment.",490,"design"
"2785","2785","By Caroline",4,"Feb 22, 2016","Great course! It gave me some great new viewpoints from which to problem solve. The case studies were relevant and interesting, and the guest speakers were good as well. I wish discussions had been a little more structured - it was kind of a free-for-all which led to a lot of off-topic nonsense to weed through. After the second week, I really stopped checking in because it was too time consuming and that's a little sad. But that would be my only suggestion for improvement.",477,"design"

"2789","2789","By Nikki K",4,"Jul 31, 2016","I love the way the course was structured and how Professor Liedtka taught the class.

"2790","2790","By Adam W",4,"Feb 23, 2017","This course was incredibly interesting and opened my mind to thinking about life and problems differently!

"2793","2793","By Paul C",4,"Dec 29, 2016","A great beginner course in the world of design thinking. One note of caution is that it underplays the concept of ""wicked problems"" and newly minted students are in for a rude shock if they tried these techniques in such situations. Consider this course your first guitar lesson, and like learning to play guitar, you will need a lot more practice to be proficient...",367,"design"

The first week and last week model didn't help me to incorporate the progress, and I grew disillusioned just listening to the video. I even had purchased the professor's book, but found the course differing significantly from the book.  Lost interest is it progressed, but completed it.",359,"design"
"2795","2795","By Nishant J",4,"Nov 13, 2016","Short and crisp course on design thinking - a good crash course and introduction to a few design thinking innovation tools that can be applied in practice almost immediately after the course is completed. practical but it can do with some more case studies and deliberate discussion questions every week to keep the discussion board focused and engaged",352,"design"
"2796","2796","By Alberto G G",4,"Jul 05, 2019","I enjoy the course. Not the final asignment, I would prefer a test of concepts, since I am not using design thinking jet and I dont have the political power in my organization to make a proposal and use it, so there is no challange I can adress jet to complete the course.

"2984","2984","By Balázs J",3,"Jan 03, 2019","I think the course is nicely structured and in the given timeframe and for the price it gives a valuable overview on design thinking (DT). On the other hand it is too short to teach any skills or give a deep insight into any of the DT tools. Thus it is to me more a management awareness training and sadly this is not clear from the description. Additionally to complete the training one has to provide a short description of a case study with one of the DT tools. In 5 weeks I think it can only be done properly if the participant is already an active coach/facilitator or working in an innovation related position. This is also not clear from the description and somewhat contradictory to the scope of the course.",715,"design"
"2985","2985","By C. C",3,"Dec 13, 2015","I previously gave this course a 5-star review; however, upon realising that there is no way to access the classroom after receiving the final grade and certificate, I simply can't give it the same excellent review. I have no way of accessing discussions and my final assignment to see any feedback classmates have given. There is also no option to re-take the final assignment, which was peer-graded and I believe I was not properly evaluated by my peers.",456,"design"
"2986","2986","By Antonia R",3,"Feb 06, 2018","Great videos and explanation of design thinking methods. The stories used as examples were illustrating the content, too. Unfortunately, I have the feeling that I do not have much written material or slides after finishing the course although I had taken notes during the videos. I guess there is no way around buying the book of the instructor! That is disappointing because I could have done that in the first place without taking this class.",444,"design"
"2987","2987","By Klaas G",3,"Jun 29, 2017","I really like the subject, but the content of this course could be more engaging. It is more or less 4 weeks/chapters of passively watching video. Of course there's a possibility to discuss things in the forum, but I prefer some kind of weekly assignments (chunking!) which let me reflect on the content learnt that week. There is also improvement possible in visualizing the key concepts/constructs/ideas of this course.",421,"design"
"2988","2988","By Thomas R",3,"Feb 08, 2018","The course is ok and gives a good first introduction to Design Thinking.  The Videos are good and allow for easy understanding. However, the course material (hand outs) provided is relatively poor. There should be at least a good sized handout of the 4 questions which are so central to the lecture. At times the course feels like a bait to sign up to the more comprehensive sessions offered by the School.",406,"design"
"2989","2989","By Tanuja P",3,"Apr 19, 2018","The subject is very useful.  But the way it has been taught --- it felt that the instructors were reading from a book.

"2990","2990","By Cortlandt C",3,"Sep 19, 2016","I audited this course.  The videos are in fact useful.

"2993","2993","By Erick A R A d l S",3,"Jan 08, 2018","In the videos you should apply the visualization tool to explain ideas further, they are purely verbal and can get to be boring.

"3024","3024","By Sean S",2,"Nov 15, 2017","Could have been better.  I learned some of the basics of Design Thinking.  The best parts were the Case Studies that were presented.  They were interesting and showed the benefit of using Design Thinking.  The parts with the most opportunity for improvement were the final exam and cutting out some of the pontificating guests speakers from industry or other schools that really added nothing to the course.  The final exam was not clear to me on the expectations and is really not practical.  It was unclear to me whether we were supposed to use a Design Thinking Tool on a problem we were facing, or to share where we used it in the past, or to reflect on how we could have used  in the past? Using on a current problem isn't practical, would take too much time, and it would need to be dumbed down to the point no confidential details are being shared.  If the assignment was to share where we used in the past, I wouldn't be taking the course as I would already have experience with Design Thinking Tools.  I chose to reflect on how I could have used DT tools on a past problem for the final exam.  Clarifying the approach in the final exam or changing it completely is recommended.",1186,"design"

If these speakers are trying to make a point it should be more concise and possibly, where applicable, linked o the course content from that week. It was clear that they wanted us to buy the book.

The content wasn't concise enough. It could have easily been a 4 week course or even shorter had they not tried to belabor each topic.

Despite the fact that the lectures were not particularly long, nor the assignments really onerous, I think I learned more in this course than in other similar courses.  Perhaps it was because there were so many ""aha!"" moments, as I realized why my previous attempts to combine typefaces had not been so successful, or exactly what it was that attracted me (or not) to the appearance of a particular type family.The story is that Steve Jobs was captivated by typography in the days when the text on the screen did not look at all like the text that would print -- people had to use codes for even simple things like bold-face or underline, and wouldn't know what it looked like until it printed on their single-typeface printer.  He fell in love with type, and that contributed a lot to the way the Macintosh developed.  I never understood that story until I took this course.Thank you for a great course, and for giving me enough knowledge that I can continue to build on it.",1011,"design"

"3507","3507","By Rama A",4,"Aug 13, 2018","This course is very good. Gave me a whole new experience with Letters. Powerful lesson in Typography. After this course, I have started noticing the words and their styles in almost everywhere I see them and in every brand. Cons: Since the assignments are graded by peers, you won't always get a grade you expect. Peers are also learning and sometimes they grade and review according to their own perceptions and knowledge. Some can be at least fair if not generous ;)",468,"design"
"3508","3508","By Melissa O",4,"Aug 17, 2017","It was nice to work with type and our own words. It felt like a more ""concrete"" change from the first course in this specialization where we only worked with shapes and lines. It would have been nice to have slightly more involved projects. It instead felt like we were packaging and repackaging the same copy for a month. I know that the intent was for us to focus on layout and placement, but after a while it felt state to be moving around the same content.",460,"design"
"3509","3509","By Chic C",4,"Nov 22, 2018","Very good course. I find some parts very convoluted with information and very fast paced. I had to keep rewinding the videos to catch all the information because it was too much for one 4 minute video in most cases. Besides from the inconvenience of having to stop and go back several several times, the information is amazing and the visual exercises are incredible.  I hate not being able to send my homework but oh well... no money.",435,"design"
"3510","3510","By Niamh F",4,"Mar 28, 2016","This class taught me a lot about the basics of typography, however I didn't feel too encouraged creatively compared to the last class in this series. I understand that type is a bit more structured and requires more attention to detail and rules than other forms of visual art, but I wish there was a bit more content similar to the content in week 4 where we are encouraged to get creative.",391,"design"
"3511","3511","By Annamaria J",4,"Aug 28, 2017","I would rate this course 3.5 stars. I had to pause and rewind the videos a lot because they were fast and packed a lot of information, which is great but it was also sort of misleading that they appeared to be short videos but in reality they  were rather ""rushed"". This course was less on hands in comparison with the first in this specialization, but altogether interesting and engaging.",391,"design"
"3512","3512","By Dan R",4,"Sep 19, 2016","The videos were very succinct and unobtrusively informative. The professor's approach was very good for a fundamentals course. My only real complaint would be the peer review system being the only provider of grades on the final project. The final grading feedback would be benefitted by the professor himself or a set of trained moderators that have more insight on design conventions.",387,"design"
"3513","3513","By Tyrand M",4,"Dec 22, 2016","I enjoyed the information, although the typography section was a bit brief. The course does help myself and others to get an idea of what an actual on-site course might consist of. I have been wanting to take a type/lettering class at my current school but have had the chance. Course was mostly informative and taught me ways to research and design.",350,"design"
"3514","3514","By keondra b f",4,"Feb 28, 2020","the course covers the very basic elements of typography. i didn’t like that all coursework was graded by peers and that the core elements of the course hadn’t been updated in years. i found the reading and resource lists very helpful and look forward to learning more throughout the graphic design certificate course",317,"design"
"3515","3515","By Alice H",4,"Oct 20, 2016","The last assignment wasn't as specific, and I wound up giving people lower grades than I should've. Be more specific when you use the phrase ""secondary piece"". I thought it was referring to the notes we took, not the text that's supposed to go below the title and subtitle.Really good class. It was very interesting.",316,"design"
"3516","3516","By Lisa J",4,"Apr 02, 2018","The information was valuable. The final two assignments were good. The last assignment made learning the material more interesting.

"3517","3517","By Dries N",4,"Jul 21, 2017","Good but should have more peer rating on creativity/originality.

"3520","3520","By Kristín L",4,"Jun 05, 2016","Overall I really enjoyed this course. My only input is that it could be a bit more advanced.

"3521","3521","By Raquel Z W",4,"Jul 18, 2017","It was really good to learn about the fundamental of Typography in this course. The only con is that, in my point of view, it is really hard to give a consistent feedback for other colleagues when you are just a beginner.

"3522","3522","By Sakshi J",4,"May 12, 2018","It was a wonderful course with brief but concise delivery of various aspects of typography. I wish the grading was done by experts and not peers, as it would have helped me receive some valuable expert feedback.",211,"design"

"3704","3704","By Matthew F",1,"Jan 26, 2020","The course is slow-paced and thorough but the necessity to have 3 peers review each assignment means it can take over a week to get a grade, by which time the student has moved on to another topic and lost the flow of this one. In addition, the final submissions are extensive and take a significant time to complete - I dont think this is worth it for a mere ""specialisation"" certificate and I have ended the course early, frankly disappointed and tired of chasing fellow students for a grade. There do not seem many people enrolled on the course and I have seen many submission over 12 months old, which the moderators still recommend I grade. I think if I were waiting 12 months for a grade on my pre-school-level ""app flow chart"" then I probably would have asked for my money back by that point.",801,"design"
"3705","3705","By Susan K",4,"Nov 27, 2018","This course was a good review of things I have touched on before in my training -- giving me a chance to apply them in a project. I like the way the project was structured in building a complete document week by week. There was some confusion in the final assignment with the site map and whether it should show ""flow"" or not. I incorporated flow, as to me ""decision points"" are a part of FLOW, but some of my peers did not see that as being the case and marked me down for adding what they call ""flow"". I recall checking course video to see if flow was a part of the assignment as I too was confused about this aspect. It might be good to review week 4 and clarify this issue for future students. Also hard to get work reviewed, seems I had to beg on forums to get them reviewed by my peers.",793,"design"

It would be very helpful if mentors also review the assignments along with peer reviewing them. Since mentors are the once who are experts in the field, their comments would really add value and mean a lot in the progress of any candidate undergoing this course.

I learned a lot while taking this.  I had no graphic design training and never used Adobe Illustrator before.  That made it a bit more challenging, but his lessons on how to use the software were perfect for the assignments.  I am really glad I took this course and would take another offered by this professor.  The class community was great, too!

"3952","3952","By Ma S G",4,"Apr 03, 2016","I did learn a lot in this course, especially for me that I am very new on this topic.  It has been challenging enough for me.  Some recommendations for improvements.1) Adjust the estimated time to complete the assignments.  It took me a lot more than the estimates to complete them.  2) The grading system especially on the final assignment is too difficult.  You need to be EXCELLENT to pass and this is difficult to achieve in a subjective peer review rating.  3) I did not expect to be responsible of providing grades for classmates.  It is not clear if the university offering the course will provide feedback.  Feedback from the experts is what I expected when I bought the certificate.4) I had to do my final assignment on a different software as my free trial subscription for Adobe Illustrator expired.Overall, it was a productive course for me and I did learn from it.",877,"design"

It is a lot of good information. But I didn't give a perfect score since I had to defer my course to a second month just so it can get marked and I actually pass. I only got one mark the first month I did it for the final assignment and needed 3 more, so deferred it to this month to get the others. For people paying for this course, this can waste a lot of money waiting an extra month.",589,"design"
"3954","3954","By Donna R",4,"Mar 15, 2018","I wish I could give the class a 4.5 star rating. It was an excellent class, though perhaps challenging for people with little or no experience with Adobe Illustrator. The instructor is *very* engaging, great on-screen presence. My only disappointment was with the quality of feedback. As far as I can tell, there is no live instructor involvement with the class. Grades are based entirely on peer reviews, and most reviewers don't bother to leave feedback. For those who do, you are being critiqued by non-designers and the feedback may not be helpful. All in all, though, worthwhile.",584,"design"

"3979","3979","By Elizabeth M",3,"Apr 02, 2016","I enjoyed this course but I was not satisfied with the assessment. The content kept me engaged and highly motivated. I acquired some very specific and useful skills, which I developed  by completing projects on topics of my choosing that were meaningful to me. I really liked Karl's casual and somewhat spontaneous style - this is a breath of fresh air from the video tutorials out there where lecturers are reading from prompts or reciting from memory. The biggest drawback to this course is that it relied completely on peer grading for the assessment (which you have to pay for). I don't think this assessment method was sufficiently designed to reduce the influence of graders who were overly subjective, hadn't sufficiently mastered the content themselves, or were disinterested in putting effort into the peer review. From now on, I will think twice about paying for any course where all of the assessment is based on how my classmates grade me. While peer review can be useful for learning, I don't think it's an accurate assessment tool. Especially if I'm paying to learn from a professional in a field, I'd expect to receive some feedback and assessment from that pro.Another area of improvement is that there were several instances where videos repeated things covered in previous videos. These things could be cleaned up a bit and the course would be more polished.",1377,"design"
"3980","3980","By Juliana T R",3,"Jul 11, 2019","The contents are very good although it feels like it's been there for a while without any kind of maintenance. Some links are broken, some information is not updated (specifically talking about Illustrator's free trial period being now shorter, which put some students in a difficult position). Overall, I felt there were not enough students for a peer-reviewed system as for some assignments it took long to get a grade because there wasn't enough peers to grade it (and reading the forum this seems like a fairly common issue). Moreover, when I had only one project left to review before I could complete the course, there was some sort of error in which it kept saying ""Review one more..."" but the page was blank with no projects loading. I kept refreshing, logging out and back in, but the problem persisted. I refuse to think there were simply no projects waiting for a grade because there's always so many people asking for a review in the forums. This led me to missing the deadline and having to reset the deadline and wait longer to complete it.I'd recommend it for the contents particularly for someone with a very basic knowledge of Illustrator although for someone who's been in the graphic design field for a while it might seem too basic.",1252,"design"
"3981","3981","By Stephen T",3,"Feb 07, 2018","It is nice.  There is a feeling that it is completely automated. The everything is peer reviewed, and you don't seem to get any input from the professor or the mentors.  I have also read on the message board, a year go someone with the exact same complaint I had.  The first project should say you need a chart and a map for your infographic. I had a really good idea for my first project, and then I realized my idea did not fit the parameters of the second assignment.  But it was still a fun topic, and not passing a few times did make me improve my work. So i am glad I too it.",581,"design"
"3982","3982","By Audrey K",3,"Apr 11, 2016","You have to use adobe illustrator to make the infographic and I didn't think the course did a good enough job giving the basics for that.

Also, NONE of the additional Illustrator tutorials that link to his YouTube page work. Please upload them to the actual course, or don't include them at all.

"3991","3991","By Philippe S",1,"Mar 08, 2016","Well, while I felt really frustrated after having played ALL of this course videos, I have first put very negative comments here for its reviewing. I have then been kindly asked to reconsider my comments under the light of the usefulness of this course to some audience. For sure, it might be that I was not of the attended audience. And I still think that this course was of no interest to me - this is the reason why I'm still pleased not to have paid for its useless certificate. Nevertheless, this course might be of interest for some students. This is definitively true. So, let me suggest a new title for it: ""Design and Make Infographics for the Dummies"". Because that's it! This course is definitively perfect for the ones who know nothing about Infographics and they might enjoy it. Finally, I shall neither modify nor remove my previous comments on the examples used by the author.Please notice that Coursera still gets all my confidence about the usefulness and the quality of their proposed courses. For instance, just have a look to the course ""Machine Learning"" of one of its co-founders, Andrew Ng.------------------------------------My previous comments here below:For sure I was not the correct audience for this course. But nothing useful to be learned in here. Karl Gude is too much speaking of what he has formerly done, which is of only interest to him. I dislike the examples he uses : violence, sex, illness, accidents, weapons, war, drugs - and fruits, ok. Are these the only topics of interest to him? Finally, it appears that the $45 certificate does not worth it. I'm pleased not to have paid for it. And I definitively not recommend this course. Waste of time if not even waste of money.",1715,"design"
"3992","3992","By Kelly S",1,"May 05, 2016","The course is misrepresented as infographics for all.  It is really infographics for journalists WITH experience in Adobe Illustrator.  There is no chance that anyone walking into the course with zero experience in AI can pass.  No chance, period!The final project grading is unfair & ridiculous.  The scoring is ""not good"", ""good"", ""excellent"".  Here's the thing... scoring ""good"" equals a fail in the project and, therefore, a fail in the course.  Your classmates with experience in adobe are scoring you based upon the instructors ""excellent"" examples.  Not realistic at all.I would also point out that the course is excellent for journalists but completely useless for those of us in the business world.  Under no circumstances would we use journalistic-style infographics in the business world.  Having worked for multiple Fortune 500's, this style would NEVER fly in the business world.  I wish I had known before I signed up.  I would never have wasted the hours, energy or money.",987,"design"
"3993","3993","By Kris M",4,"Sep 07, 2018","FIRST -  I think this could be improved with more quizes and things to break up the video. Some of us struggle to stay conscious and attentive when things aren't interactive. This would be a great help and also a good test of knowledge and understanding. ESPECIALLY please for the love of god put some quizes or questions in to break up vids that are long like 17 mins! (even, i'd say, break up even the 7 min ones. there is no downside to quick questions that test to make sure you are understanding the material)  SECOND - the amount of time estimated for the last assignment is sorely underrated. to do 100 ideas in one hour would mean 30 seconds to type each up, and this excludes the time needed to THINK and come up with new ideas. as an individual this felt impossible.  not to mention the time to draft the 5 ideas. i did sketches with notations and a scenario. all told this needs to be 2-8 hours. (i can see where someone could get away with a shorter time due to not fleshing out their scenarios, and in fact the ones I graded were a lot like this. HOWEVER, at least one of those people also reported it took them DAYS to generate all the ideas. i agree this process is intense, and takes a LOT of time.) my grading of 2 peers took me almost an hour. (again, i could see where a person could shlep by with short responses but i was trying to really evaluate these ideas, offer cons and suggestions around them. i feel this helped my learning process also, as i was treating it like a real world approach (as if i was on a job). i did the same with drafting my 5 ideas/drawings.",1588,"design"

Questions are presented within the videos to make sure you are keeping track. A lot of hints for further reading are given. Great learning material!There are two minor points I would like to mention although they do in no way make me downrate the course. The part on the quantitative analysis I found a little too shallow and short - but on the other hand, these methods are more common and easily accessable in statistics courses and books. The ideation assignment I found a little hard - to come up with 100 ideas alone, not in a team which the method is designed for.

Some of us struggle to stay conscious and attentive when things aren't interactive. This would be a great help and also a good test of knowledge and understanding. ESPECIALLY please for the love of god put some quizes or questions in to break up vids that are long like 17 mins! (even, i'd say, break up even the 7 min ones. there is no downside to quick questions that test to make sure you are understanding the material)  SECOND - the amount of time estimated for the last assignment is sorely underrated. to do 100 ideas in one hour would mean 30 seconds to type each up, and this excludes the time needed to THINK and come up with new ideas. as an individual this felt impossible.  not to mention the time to draft the 5 ideas. i did sketches with notations and a scenario. all told this needs to be 2-8 hours. (i can see where someone could get away with a shorter time due to not fleshing out their scenarios, and in fact the ones I graded were a lot like this. HOWEVER, at least one of those people also reported it took them DAYS to generate all the ideas. i agree this process is intense, and takes a LOT of time.) my grading of 2 peers took me almost an hour. (again, i could see where a person could shlep by with short responses but i was trying to really evaluate these ideas, offer cons and suggestions around them. i feel this helped my learning process also, as i was treating it like a real world approach (as if i was on a job). i did the same with drafting my 5 ideas/drawings.",1588,"design"

Great learning material!There are two minor points I would like to mention although they do in no way make me downrate the course. The part on the quantitative analysis I found a little too shallow and short - but on the other hand, these methods are more common and easily accessable in statistics courses and books. The ideation assignment I found a little hard - to come up with 100 ideas alone, not in a team which the method is designed for.

was put into the creation of this course. However, I found that a lot of topics
could be handled a lot more in-depth. The assessment at the end of a week was not
really challenging and does not require a deep understanding of the concepts.
Some of the quizzes were more challenging but in the assessments it was often
only required to answer questions based on graphs or other images of
functions. Most of the programming assignments only required the student
to fill in some easier blanks.I still do not know what the Taylor
Series Chapter was about. I guess this is an important concept but I was
not sure how this relates to machine learning. If you call a course Math

Learning.Maybe, it

"4395","4395","By Rinat T",4,"Aug 01, 2018","the part about neural networks needs improvement (some more examples of simple networks, the explanation of the emergence of the sigmoid function). exercises on partial derivatives need to be focused more on various aspects of partial differentiation rather than on taking partial derivatives of some complicated functions. I felt like there was too much of the latter which is not very efficient because the idea of partial differentiation is easy to master but not always its applications. just taking partial derivatives of some sophisticated functions (be it for the sake of Jacobian or Hessian calculation) turns into just doing lots of algebra the idea behind which has been long understood. so while some currently existing exercises on partial differentiation, Jacobian and Hessian should be retained, about 50 percent or so of them should be replaced with exercises which are not heavy on algebra but rather demonstrate different ways and/or applications in which partial differentiation is used. otherwise all good.",1025,"math"
"4396","4396","By Ronny A",4,"Jun 27, 2018","Course is pretty good. I like how well thought out the assignments are and the use of visualizations, even in the assignments, to enrich intuitive understanding. There were a couple of instances where the content wasn't clear and I referenced Khan Academy to clarify things for myself. The reason I give this course a 4-start rather than a 5-star is that it seems the teachers or else TAs were not responsive. Specifically, myself and another person had posted in the discussion forum how it seemed one of the slides had a typo in the Jacobian contour plot. There was no official response to this.",597,"math"
"4397","4397","By Fang Z",4,"Jul 11, 2019","I really love Samuel's teaching style. He strived to make people understood by showing a lot of graph and I can easily follow him step by step. However, David's teaching I couldn't follow up his mind much maybe because less explanations given during the lecture. In addition, I found some quiz have huge amount of calculated amount which I really spent a lot time to verify the answer. Finally, I hope more detailed explanations could be given if I made mistakes in some quiz  so I could boost what I've learned so far. Thanks,Fang",531,"math"
"4398","4398","By Hermes J D R P",4,"Feb 28, 2020","The first 4 weeks of the course were amazing: great content, clear explanations and fair and interactive assessment activities. However, the last 2 weeks weren't as good as the previous ones. That's why I don't give this course 5 stars. By and large, the first two courses of this specialization are the best resources available on the internet to learn the foundations of mathematics for Machine Learning. I recommend that instead of doing the last course, you had better try to read the related book wrote by Deisenroth.",522,"math"
"4399","4399","By Saras A",4,"Jan 29, 2020","Good course.  I wish it had more sections as in a total of 12 sections or weeks and more steps to gain a more thorough graphical understanding (and perhaps even a more mathematical/algebraic understanding however overall that's much easier for me on that front...).From a Data Science or Machine Learning perspective Week 6 (linear regression and non linear regression with chi-squared methods etc) were the most interesting.",425,"math"
"4400","4400","By Dan L",4,"Mar 30, 2019","The course accomplishes its goal of connecting concepts in calculus to machine learning, and is appropriately paced for students who have covered calculus in the past and are seeking a refresher or deeper understanding of its applications to real-world problems. For those who don't already have a certain minimum familiarity with the mathematics, however, the course will probably move at too fast a pace.",406,"math"
"4401","4401","By Matt P",4,"Jul 19, 2018","Great class - very informative and eye opening - even with quite a bit of linear algebra background. Really liked the eigenvector and eigenvalue section - great descriptions. I wish the neural network discussion went on a bit further. I found some of the programming assignments' instructions a bit vague and confusing - what should have taken a few minutes ends up taking a half hour.",385,"math"
"4402","4402","By Aneev D",4,"Oct 19, 2018","This course is great in the sheer efficiency with which it goes through the content required to prepare you for machine learning.

Some parts are confusing, and I recommend looking at Khan Academy for the lectures on Jacobians and steepest ascent, and 3Blue1Brown for feedforward neural networks.",357,"math"
"4403","4403","By Wenyuan Z",4,"Jan 11, 2019","Well the course is generally good, the only problem is that David sometimes may just skip the process and lack more explanation when performing the calculation, it's easy to lose track of what he is calculating if not reviewing the video over and over again, but anyway, the whole class is worth recommendation, thank you for your teaching, professors",351,"math"
"4404","4404","By Mihai R F",4,"Nov 01, 2019","Very valuable training course from the insight/intuition point of view. This is more of an overview of the calculus for machine learning giving the student a good direction of what to study and where to start from. I think that actually mastering the subject will require extensive additional exercises from other sources",321,"math"

The problem is that most of my knowledge came from elsewhere while the explanations by the course instructors were quite unclear till I referred to extra resources. At the same time, some other explanations were on the obvious side, so I'd say the instructions are kind of inconsistent in their difficulty. The real-life examples were relly good though. The same concerns the quizzes, some are absolutely great and intuitive, while the others just leave you puzzled about what you are even expected to do with no extra info offered when failed.  The course is kind of sloppier than the first one and the reviews say the third one is even worse, so I won't be doing it. Finally, I cannot even complete the last graded assignment and get my certificate as well as some other learners because the thing just throws an error all the time.

Unfortunately the topics are extremely hastily presented and lack depth of explanation, sufficient examples and often leave out content required to complete the assignments. The material is not presented in a coherent way, and, for someone new to Linear Algebra like me, requires a great amount of self-study outside the course (e.g. Khan Academy) to comprehend the content. The team of lecturers is very likeable and enthusiastic. However, I do not comprehend where this course seeks to position itself: it is not suited for students new to Linear Algebra, and, not extensive enough for someone seeking to learn underlying mathematics for Machine Learning as this course simply doesn't cover Machine Learning. Finishing this course, I have some vague understanding of certain concepts and I am left longing for proper and structured content that I could feel confident about.",982,"math"

"4486","4486","By Andrew M",2,"Mar 15, 2019","Disclaimer: If you are familiar with Linear Algebra, you may love this course. This review is not for those people. This review is for the people who went to the course details, saw that the recommended audience was 'Beginner' level, and decided to give it a try, thinking it involved a low barrier of entry. You'd be thinking incorrectly. Here is why.  Let me start off by stating two things. First: I am terrible at all things mathematics, and wanted to improve my capabilities in this area. Second: This is by far the worst Coursera course that I've taken to date. I put all my effort into not only completing the course, but doing so on time, so that I don't dump more money into a course than completely necessary. With this course, I found myself loathing the prospect of torturing myself with the material, that I kept putting it off. I eventually had to come to terms that I hated this whole experience, and canceled my subscription prior to completing even the first course!1.) The videos are absolutely useless - Up-to-date on all the latest and great math jargon? Well, you'd better be, or else you'll find yourself Googling terms like a madman and re-watching the videos over and over, just to get a grasp on what is going on. All this is topped off with the instructor talking a mile a minute (does he even breathe?) and making numerous mistakes throughout the videos. This will then prompt you to pause the video you were watching to go search the forums in order to see if the way you were taught to do something in a previous video was incorrect all along, just to find a post that confirms that the video did in fact have an error. Do yourself a favor and skip directly to the practice quizzes. You'll be equally clueless as to what is going on, but you won't have wasted time by watching pointless videos.2.) I'm assuming the assignments and practices quizzes are in some way correlated to the subject matter depicted in said useless videos in point 1. If there is, then the questions therein are massively beefed up version of the subject. Nothing made me feel quite as stupid as practice quiz 1 of week 4 (this is where I finally gave up and called it quits). The only redeeming factor is that I'm not the only doofus in the room. The student forums are full of equally clueless people.3.) For the price of $50 a month, I expected this course to house all I would need to ease me into the topic of Linear Algebra. Instead, it feels like I've been thrown into the ocean with cinder blocks strapped to my feet without knowing how to swim. Logically, I started grasping for the life boats that are Khan Academy and YouTube. I shouldn't have to go to external resources if I'm paying money to be taught something, but I did. Even though these external resources helped me better understand the concepts, the quiz material still looked like absolutely gibberish to me. That's when I knew this was no ""Beginner"" course.All said, just buy a Linear Algebra text book off of Amazon if you want to learn this topic. It's cheaper in the long run, and coupled with Khan Academy, it'll get you farther. The only reason it isn't a single star for me is the fact that maybe it is beneficial for people who actually like math.",3230,"math"
"4487","4487","By Juan D",2,"Mar 20, 2019","The teacher's explanation videos are excellent, really really clear: it makes you feel as though they really paid attention on how to deliver the content in the most understandable way possible. The teacher speaks clearly, the audio and the subtitles are on point, etc.  Unfortunately, this all goes in flames when compared to the mess that is the evaluation system, which seems to jump two or three orders of magnitude in difficulty compared to what is actually taught in the lessons. This, in turn, makes it impossible to know whether the failure to get correct answers is due to one's own lack of competence, the bad quality of the lessons, or the lack of competence on the part of those tasked with creating the quizzes.  Based on my experience, as well as on the comments by other people equally baffled by the quizzes -not to mention the almost absolute absence of mentors willing to help out-, I strongly suspect it is the latter.  In my opinion, the course's effectiveness could dramatically increased if it included a lot more exercises at different levels of difficulty, in order for the students to really absorb each unit's contents. This would also have the advantage of preparing them for the really difficult questions on the ""big quizzes"".",1256,"math"

If you come to a course like this one is because you are interested in ML so python is something you will surely be using, so learning a bit before engaging this course would be a first step.Regarding the maths, this course doesn't go in depth  in maths theorems and stuff like that, it explains in a visual way what you need and then use the maths to accomplish it.",703,"math"

The last quiz seems quite disconnected with the lectures and there isn't a support guide or tutorial not even a mentor answering the questions in the week 5 forum.

The topics covered are not as many as in a serious course in linear algebra, but the ones covered really help you get to a genuine understanding. The assignment basically consist in rewriting in python what you see in the slides. If you are familiar even at a very basic level with Python, it will take you less than 5 minutes to complete the assignments, they are not challenging at all in that sense. But they do help visualize what is taught in the vides, which I guess is the purpose.

"5166","5166","By Vern",4,"Apr 11, 2018","I would give this course 5 stars for the fact that in five weeks, the course is able to go through perhaps a semester or two or three of Linear Algebra (LA), and how LA fits into data science.  I gave it four stars because I believe the program should include lots of links to reference and learning aid resources.  Because I had done a couple other courses on LA relatively recently, some these arcane LA concepts were grasped with some, but not too much, effort.If you are even just a little familiar with LA, this course will give you a good foundation for the LA relative to data science.  So, if this is you, and you want to get into Machine Learning (ML) to understand how ML works internally, then jump right in.Thanks to all who contributed to make this a great ride.",776,"math"
"5167","5167","By John G",4,"Sep 30, 2018","Overall, the course is good and well worth your time if you goal is to brush on Linear Algebra. It is pretty important that you have been exposed to linear algebra before though, as some topics are covered pretty quickly. My only complaint is that there was a lot of unnecessary obfuscation. The lectures constantly alluded to things without actually naming them (e.g., gradient descent in one of the earlier lectures). I found the ""Essence of Linear Algebra"" video series on YouTube to be invaluable to actually making sense of some of the lectures in this course, so if you do take this course I suggest doing the same!",621,"math"
"5168","5168","By sreekar",4,"Sep 13, 2018","For purposes of learning (refreshing) linear algebra for machine learning, this course is a great tool. There were some blips here and there, where the explanations are lacking , but overall a good resource. i have to add that this combined with 3Blue1brown LA series provides optimal learning than the course alone. 3Blue1Brown provides better intuition while this course will walk you through the more rigorous math part of it. for best results ofcourse you may have to do solve lots of Text book problems yourself. (there is a recommended text book, but not necessary for passing grade or completing course)",610,"math"
"5169","5169","By Tim Z",4,"Mar 31, 2018","Actually I have learned linear algebra before but forget a lot, so I want to use this course to review it and help me prepare for the study of machine learning. As a computer science student(sophomore), I think the coding assignments are too easy for me. But it indeed introduce the core concept and equations in linear algebra, which are quite useful for future learning. In my opinion, freshman students or students just graduated from high school may feel more satisfied with this course. And it is better for students who have learned linear algebra before to find harder courses to learn.",593,"math"
"5170","5170","By Harsh S",4,"Jul 25, 2018","Good course for your first step into machine learning. Very engaging. Great application with the PageRank problem. The course does dive into the core understandings of linear algebra and you do develop a sound mathematical intuition. The coding isn't very difficult and has been eased for non-programmers. However, what happened for a keen learner like myself is that I wrote code which I didn't understand very well myself, but still managed to get a full score. This made me a bit uneasy. Otherwise, an awesome course to get started on and it is possible to finish in two weeks.Enjoy!!",587,"math"
"5171","5171","By Marc P",4,"Apr 19, 2019","Excellent course to refresh linear algebra basics, build intuition and see the subject from a machine learning perspective. I wouldn't recommend it for people that are new to the subject, since the pace is fast, much is omitted and the assignments aren't always easy. Every now and then, the calculations come before the intuition, which can be tricky to follow. However, most of the course is very didactic and the combination of videos and challenges kept me motivated throughout.   I suggest the youtube channel of 3Blue1Brown whenever you feel lost with the subject at hand.",579,"math"
"5172","5172","By Mohammad O B S",4,"Sep 29, 2019","Instructors have done a really good job at introducing the fundamentals specially from a graphical point of view which allows you to build your grasp strongly around the topics in a way that is not accomplished in a traditional college classroom. However, I would say perhaps there could be more challenging questions on the real world applications of linear algebra in machine learning followed by in-depth step-by-step solutions in order to really get the application-based learning inside your meat.",503,"math"
"5173","5173","By Gabriel L S",4,"Aug 12, 2019","I like the the structure of explaining the theory using examples (in this case, geometric/visual examples). However, I would love to have further understanding on the basic linear algebra topics (or at least be linked to websites that explain this further) to allow flexibility to students like me who has zero knowledge on linear operations.  Overall, I was able to overcome the challenged through self learning, understand the concepts well, and appreciate the applications in machine learning.",497,"math"
"5174","5174","By Yuriy G",4,"Jan 31, 2019","Thanks a lot for this course! The explanations and lecturer work were brilliant!It's very good for introduction but it lacks a strict wording, definitions and some generalizations. Especially in the section of changing basis. When after considering a number of examples, I really want to move on to the general case.Anyway, you've a made a great work because anyone without any preparation can get acquainted with very deep mathematical ideas.",444,"math"
"5175","5175","By Nikita V M",4,"Feb 06, 2020","Excellent instructors and video quality. Some frustrating elements with assignments being either somewhat unclear or redundant. The only severe flaw was that grader feedback was entirely pointless, as it made no effort to even give an example of what went wrong. Simply saying that something was incorrect without providing, say, an example of the input matrix that failed, in no way helped advance my understanding of the problem.",431,"math"
"5176","5176","By William L",4,"May 19, 2018","Video lectures are great and really help with understanding why you are learning the material and what the concepts mean.  The programming assignments and quizzes are challenging.  There were some cases where I did not understand the quiz question and did not know why I got it wrong or even correct if I guessed.  Access to solutions after completing a graded assignment or even after the course would be beneficial.",417,"math"
"5177","5177","By James G",4,"Apr 01, 2018","It's quite good. The material implies they are aiming to teach linear algebra and basic Python programming basically from scratch, but it goes over topics so quickly and skims over so many details that I suspect this course only works if you've studied much of it before. Even though I have studied much of this before I still had to go and find other sources of information, as the explanations here are so brief.",414,"math"
"5178","5178","By Kitty",4,"Jun 12, 2019","Generally great course. Explanations are very clear. Cons: ① no textbook/slides/reading materials etc., have to take notes and screenshots for every single thing you want to record. ② The content is not enough. Way too less knowledge covered than college-level linear algebra course. I took this course to refresh my knowledge and it turned out that more than half of the contents are the ones I still remember.",412,"math"
"5179","5179","By Amit A",4,"Aug 30, 2019","Eigenvalues and eigenvectors while explained conceptually very well, the jump to page rank and transformations using them was bit hand wavy. May be it is not that important or the topic is too complex. I think I have to go through it multiple times to get the gist of it once again.

"5180","5180","By Pavel S",4,"Dec 13, 2019","The biggest problem of this course is that dot-products are introduced before linear transfomations. I understood dot products through 3blue1brown videos and they are more intuitively explained as the product of the lengths of the projection and the vector projected onto. It is a subset of linear transformation a matrix vector multiplication where one of vectors is transposed.",379,"math"
"5181","5181","By Fang Z",4,"Jun 11, 2019","The course generally is good. However I think there are some problems in this course: 1. The course pace is too fast,  some concepts are hard to understand with few minutes lecture   2. The after-practice didn't help me to boost my understanding to the lecture. Even after I finished the practice, I still wonder why this happens   3. The final quiz has too much calculations.",380,"math"
"5182","5182","By Prasad N R",4,"Sep 30, 2019","I was expecting a lot from the course. But, it covers only the very basic portions. For example, I am not sure if I can start understanding the difficulties with normal equations and portions of linear algebra based on calculus. Also, it does not discuss parallelism of ML with linear algebra. I am not sure if this will help me read and understand Andrew Ng's ML papers.",371,"math"
"5183","5183","By Musiboyina Y",4,"May 27, 2018","The course content was spot-on, covering some of the most important basics for math in machine learning. I wish there were more programming exercise based assignments and less hand-calculation based quizzes to make it close to real world applications. Overall, loved this course and highly recommend it to data science enthusiasts taking baby steps towards deep learning.",371,"math"
"5184","5184","By Shashank S",4,"Aug 05, 2018","This course has provided everything that it had promised.

"5185","5185","By Julio V",4,"Sep 27, 2018","I feel like some part should've gone a bit more in depth.

Would be quite nice in these cases if you could point to other sources, books, etc. Or maybe do a compilation of sources based on what the students have used to get unstuck on particular issues.",352,"math"

"5326","5326","By Reed R",3,"Jul 14, 2018","The stated goal of the course is to provide a sufficient base of knowledge in linear algebra for applied data science i.e. (a) to teach linear algebra without gory proofs or endless grinding through algorithms by hand and (b) to foreground geometric interpretations of linear algebra that can be recalled for many data science techniques and visualized with common data science tools. While I appreciate this goal and enjoyed the early foray into projection, I never felt the ""a ha"" moments I did as an undergrad in a class that used Gil Strang's ""Introduction to Linear Algebra"" (which I reread alongside this course as a supplement). The course seems to ask for some faith that various concepts introduced earlier in the course will be united by the end, but never makes good; opting instead for a kind of sleight of hand: having students implement the Page Rank algorithm with the intention that this will draw together the core concepts of the course. It could be that I was just looking for a more complete treatment of the subject than the course ever intends to offer, but I strongly felt that with a bit of restructuring, that the subject could be presented primarily intuitively, but with a level of clarity and artfulness in its conclusion that will ensure that students remember the core concepts beyond when they remember its presentation.",1351,"math"
"5327","5327","By Eitan A",3,"Jan 13, 2020","As of this writing, I am almost done with week 4 of Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra. The content of the course is excellent and professor David Dye's lectures are to be commended no doubt. The reason for my low rating is because the programming assignments are broken and that's really not acceptable for paid offering such as this. To clarify, at various points throughout this course, students are asked to complete a programming assignment. The student is presented with a button which says, ""Open Notebook"". The student is supposed to click this button and be redirected to a Jupyter Notebook (and interactive Python execution environment). Unfortunately, instead of being redirected, click on this button results in a ""404 Not Found"" error. There are various discussions in the class discussion forum regarding this issue (some months old), but no action has been taken to resolve this issue. Luckily, someone taking the course managed to find the programming assignments and posted them on google docs for others to use. I've been working these which is fine, but as I said, we're paying for these courses, someone should be resolving this.",1163,"math"
"5328","5328","By Anweshita D",3,"Jun 29, 2018","Your discussion forum really needs to be better. It seems to be the only place where any sort of doubt clearing can be done and very rarely have I seen TA's answering unless it's a grading issue. The problem with this sort of answering is that if any coding concepts are unclear, either they are solved by trial and error or after going through Google multiple times. And for a course that is paid for, I shouldn't have to make this much of an effort just to have my doubts cleared.",482,"math"

"5362","5362","By Fuad E",2,"May 22, 2019","It is a little messy: there are no clear definitions of Vector Space, Normed Vector Space, Euclidean Vector Space. Functions as COS and SIN are used to show basic concepts, orthogonal base, and so on. ""Projection"" concept always relies on base being orthogonal, projection being under 90 degree (what is 90 degree in vector space?), and space being Euclidean, although it is much simpler and applicable for just Vector Space (space without ""norm"" defined). Good introductory course for high-school; bad for University. Good for kids who just finished learning Pythagoras Theorem, SIN, COS, and basis of Euclidean geometry. Example of house (with number of rooms which is positive Integer number, and price which is positive Decimal) is not really a vector. Examples of non-Euclidean spaces and their applications in machine learning not provided (geometrical deep learning on graphs for example). Basic course for those completely unfamiliar with what ""vector"" is. Provided tests in Python are confusing because in the context we write vectors (and ""base"" vectors which matrix consists from) vertically, and in Python - horizontally. For example, [[1,2],[3,4]] is matrix, but it won't transform base vector [1,0] into [1,2]. This is confusing and should be mentioned before test begins.Thank you for helping me to recall this knowledge. I finished three weeks; I may need to update review later.",1395,"math"

"5378","5378","By Vishal G",5,"Dec 03, 2018","I came into this course thinking that it was going to be something relatively basic - being my first MOOC I wanted to do something which is new but not too difficult so I can see what online courses are like.The first week is mostly easy but was still interesting with its novel application of recursion to seemingly difficult problems like the staircase one but the second week stands out mostly for both its difficulty and use of other areas of math to prove results in far better ways - Cassini's identity with the Q matrix in particular. The second week's content is manageable and the entire course only requires understanding of mathematical induction and the manipulation of matrices, both of which have supplementary material to complement the course for those who don't know it or have forgotten how to do it. The exercises set are some of the most insightful I've seen - Catalan's identities proof in particular. Solving that one is worthy of commendation. A system of hints or solutions may be useful for the more difficult exercises like that one but it's mostly an exception among the others. The second week is mostly isolated to the others, mostly for the introduction of useful algebraic results which tie Fibonacci numbers together rather than for the end goal which is outlined in week 3 with the construction of the Fibonacci and golden spirals. I personally found week 2 the best but week 3 was the main part of the course. It stays mostly easier than week 2 except the difficulty spike in the first exercise about the Eye of God, I recommend watching the video which comes after it before attempting that exercise. Overall, this is an enjoyable course with some very surprising results and manages to go deeper into seemingly simple concepts like the Fibonacci numbers than expected. Thanks Professor Chasnov for a great first course which is definitely suitable to beginners with the way it eases students into the concepts introduced and the great explanations. Recursion in particular is explained extremely well.",2038,"math"
"5379","5379","By Bethany B",5,"Jan 03, 2020","I thoroughly enjoyed this course!  I was looking for something fun to study over my 3-week winter break (I'm a student at IU), and thought this looked intriguing.  Indeed, I learned so many fascinating things that heightened my love for and appreciation of the complex (literally complex, as well) world of mathematics.  I was so continually interested that I just had to keep going with the course until the end!  I have a fairly strong background in math (I've taken Calc I, II, and III, and Linear Algebra) so I was able to do the quizzes and most of the hw problems (though I never completely understood proofs by induction).  I had no idea that there were this many relationships between the Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Ratio, and that these intertwined ideas show up elsewhere in real-world situations.  As an aspiring professional musician, I'd be very interested to see if and how these show up in music - I myself may have to write something that utilizes and highlights the golden ratio!  I've encouraged many of my friends to take this course - it's highly rewarding and one of my favorite courses I've ever taken.  The professor was wonderful, and clearly very enthusiastic about these mathematical phenomena.  Thank you to all who put this together!",1267,"math"
"5380","5380","By Lam C K R",5,"Feb 16, 2020","A fun and engaging introductory mathematics course! Professor Chasnov did a really good job on introducing this topic! The exercises focused on the Fibonacci number and its counterpart, the Lucas Number, and it is aesthetically pleasing to see the connection behind mathematics and nature!One thing I love about this course is that you don't have to know a lot of mathematics beforehand, just simple algebra will do. There is also a preliminary quiz to see if you are familiar with the basic algebra or not, which is a very good design!A lot of the exercises in this course is about mathematical induction, which is an extremely important skill in university mathematics. So this course provides an extremely useful insight into it!All in all, it is a wonderful journey through mathematics! Absolutely recommend to people who love mathematics and want to study it at university!",878,"math"
"5381","5381","By Boudokhane M",5,"Jan 24, 2019","This course has been really fun and informative. I have learned a lot about Fibonacci numbers which i never considered to be that important. At first i thought they were just some quirky numbers and never looked further because they are usually just mentioned in our regular courses but nothing more. This course showed how important they are, their occurrence in nature, their real world application and a multitude of ways to find them and represent them.The format of this course was also excellent, the videos are rich in content but still entertaining and easy to follow, some of the later ones are worth watching several times because they are quite packed in information. The problems are both challenging and amusing.overall, i'm really satisfied with this course and i would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in math.",840,"math"
"5382","5382","By Lim S M",5,"Jan 03, 2020","Very interesting course and the topic is covered comprehensively. Though this course is run every week, the instructor replies promptly to any questions asked. Most of the exercises are proofs which was good practice, though I found them rather too challenging for my standard. However, this is inevitable, as these proofs directly relate to formulas which will be used and are not just random exercises and thus I am grateful for the solutions provided by the pdf. Any gaps are also filled in well by the lecture notes pdf provided, though some proofs will be more challenging to understand. Great course for anyone interested in this rather niche area of mathematics.",669,"math"

Instructor explains the concepts well, and the personal element adds to the course. Gives new insight into the meaning of numbers and definitely helps improve certain math skills such as proving statements, geometry, algebra etc. Quizzes are easy, a light course in terms of assessments overall.. One downside is that the questions have no solutions posted (at least I could not find it) so we do not have a correct framework for answering these types of questions. Also, some videos had an excessive non-mathematical, historical and oriental side to them which did not exactly appeal to me. However, definitely a unique course that will provide you with a unique perspective.",764,"math"

I found that many of the examples in the videos and the model answers to the questions missed lots of steps that I needed.

"5488","5488","By Ho X V",5,"Jun 21, 2018","My love for Mathematics in the past few years is like the electrocardiogram (Điện tâm đồ) of a near-death patient, which is peaceful as the surface of a calm lake. This does not annoy me at all, despite for the fact that I used to be called the smartest one in class, in this specific topic particularly. Then, how did I end up like this? Fortunately, Professor Keith Devlin points out that this is not exceptional. It is not true that people are born to be good or bad at math by default, and keep up the trend till they die. In fact, there is always a transformation in mathematical thinking from high school to university level, that almost no one was told when they were students. Moving from being taught a fixed set of techniques to solve a problem, now you are asked to be able to abstract things and reason about it, which naturally confuse learners. To prepare for such transformation, this is the exact course you need.  My personal opinion: I wish that I have taken this course 5 years ago, so I can learn a bit more about Algebra. First year undergraduate students, mark my words: take it!.  Course review: In the first half of the course, Professor teaches the importance of understanding the primitive mathematical notations, how careful you should be when formulate a problem, and do not rush when attack it. The quizzes successfully demonstrate the second and third points.  In the second half, it's amazing to see how one can derive mathematical reasoning solely from the truth tables, and apply it to produce appropriate techniques to solve problems. Only now that I know it's not black magic when somebody choose an arbitrary value that I have no idea where it comes from in a proof. In the last 2 weeks, he gives us a few touch on set theory and real analysis, the two subjects that I suddenly feel attracted to, not to mention his sense of humour when introducing them ;)  Notably, throughout the whole course, Professor shows us how to evaluate a proof, and I do learn a thing or two about it. As he always says, the point of a proof is 1) establising the truth and 2) explaining it for the readers, math will be interesting once you learn its way of thinking.  I now feel more ready than ever to read a mathematical problem; specifically, where to look for in the beginning of a proof, and the abstract idea of how the authors come up with their chain of deduction.

"5502","5502","By steve g",5,"Feb 09, 2020","Professor Keith Devlin wrote and participated in this course for some years. He has stepped away from it since (he explains why in a post on  https://mooctalk.org/ ) but the course remains a valid educational experience. I return to it every so often, mainly to have a go at answering other learners' questions on the discussion forums - which is a learning experience in itself- and try out different approaches to proof-writing. I can do this because the course has a peer-review element at the end, where your work will be read and reviewed by other students. If a given approach is faulty, difficult to follow or contains a mistake that you have over-looked, one of your fellow students will pick up on it. This might sound daunting but, ultimately, it is a much better deal than just satisfying yourself. A third aspect of this course which is challenging is that you are also assigned the task of reviewing other people's work, which is a surprisingly difficult thing to do well - your target is complete and constructive feedback, with each of your grading decisions  explained and sound advice given - that demands a thorough understanding of the course material and also of the traps and pit-falls which  are all too easy to fall into and which can, ultimately, demotivate a student if they fall foul of one and you, as the reviewer, are not 'on their side' .",1373,"math"

One more comment on the final peer review assignment: the question about whether 0 is a natural number.Only after taking this course and doing some research on the Internet do I realise that there's a lot of argument on this question. I am a college student from China, and I major in physics, rather than mathematics. For me, the statement ""0 is the least natural number"" is a fact that was written in my primary school's textbook. So I was quite surprised when I was told that 0 is not a natural number. After searching on the Internet, I finally got more knowledge on this. Fortunately I was not supposed to lose too much on that. However, I do recommend that you make this clear in the course content so that everyone can discuss under a common assumption, regardless of their background education.Above all, this course experience is a lot of fun. There's no standard answers here, only remarkable thinking and a space of infinity to explore. Thank you for all of it! I'm giving 23 out of 24 marks for this course, taking away 1 point for clarity about whether 0 is a natural number.",1211,"math"

I'm not sure if it can clear all my confusions about symbols, but the light weight of the content has captured the gist of college mathematics. Even after I have graduated from college for 7 years and have rarely used something like partial differential equations, this course brings all the math I learnt back to life in a few hours. I also recommend following Prof. Keith Devlin's twitter.

"5787","5787","By Nico S",4,"Mar 20, 2017","Here you will learn the  basic skills for writing and judging proofs. At core, the taught material consists of the content of Keith Devlin's book 'Introduction to Mathematical Thinking', which is available for low fee. But at this course are come lots of students together and they can help each other at struggling through the plenty exercises which accompany the lectures. And there is also some help from several mentors.In the last week you have to write your own proofs at ten problem sets and peer reviewing them for lots of other students.negatives: Because the instructor suggested group building over the net, It happened at my course that the course participants was split to plenty small groups. And although it's a pretty good Idea that the Instructor presents the learning stuff at the videos by writing it on a small sheet with a pen, his handwriting is sometimes so terrible that it's hardly to read.",915,"math"
"5788","5788","By Hariprasad G",4,"Feb 15, 2018","It is clear that a lot of effort has gone into developing this MOOC, with engaging content and splendid delivery by Prof. Devlin throughout. This is commendable, especially considering the course is traditionally meant for a conventional classroom and a lot of peer interaction, which is hard to simulate in a MOOC. The Rubric was a little hard to wrap your head around, and often I found my views clashing with that of the instructor (I'm sure he's right, but as a student it's not always easy to see where he's coming from. For example, if you've been lenient in your moderation and given a middling score to a proof, but he's gone on to trash the same proof)Having said that, it was a delight to learn with the Professor, who emphasizes first principles, assumes nothing, and teaches you to do the same.",807,"math"

"5836","5836","By Robyn J",1,"Feb 08, 2017","This course is very strong with respect to presenting the concepts you need to know for data science. It is extremely WEAK in terms explaining those concepts. If you are like me and did this kind of math back in the 70's and 80's but have not used it since, be prepared to seek sources outside Coursera in order to understand the material and pass the quizzes. The instructors leave out explanations and skip important points leaving you confused about the concept. 
Example: In the Permutations and Combinations sections, ""results"" of calculations are thrown at you with no explanation of how the instructor got the answer. 10 minutes later, totally as an aside, you get the explanation. The course is not taught in such a way that A leads to B, B leads to C, and C leads.....; instead the instructor will tell you about C, might explain A, and forget about mentioning B until the graded quiz. That is why you will need to fill in the gaps using websites like betterexplained.com or kahnacademy.com.
The student is better served by looking at the syllabus and then going to either of those sites - where the explanations are worth your time.
In addition to failing to present steps in a logical order, the course often teaches at an extremely basic level but tests at a much, much higher level. Again, to get to the higher level of understanding needed to pass ANY of the required, graded quizzes, the student will need to heavily utilize outside sources. The explanations on the practice quizzes also fail in many cases to thoroughly explain why an answer is correct.
Then there are the issues with Coursera itself, the course navigation using Chrome is quite bad. If I did not constantly monitor what part of a course I should be in versus what part of the course automatically loaded next, I often found myself taking a quiz for which no lectures had been presented. The TA's response to my complaint was flippant and WRONG. She then closed my question and I could not respond or ask for more details.If I had it to do over again I would invest my time and money somewhere else. In my opinion, Coursera should rescind the instructors' rights to charge for this course until the instructors improve and meet higher teaching standards.",2237,"math"

I am sure the teachers know their stuff but they have no idea on teaching it clearly based on the material presented in this course.

"5844","5844","By Shawn T R",5,"Aug 08, 2018","Overall the course was great. Shored up my knowledge on a number of subjects. Could have used better explanations of certain topics though. There were a couple of instances where the instructors simply show you how to use a particular equation to deal with a particular kind of problem without explaining why it works. For concepts to really sink in you need to get a deep intuition for how they operate. I think these intuitions were provided for the main concepts, but there were some sub-concepts, where they essentially just gave you the method without getting into how it works. It's fine to know how to use it, but without a deep intuition it's just memorization.Overall I really liked this course though. The quizzes and tests were challenging and fun and I came away with a much better knowledge of the subject matter, especially probability. I'm not a scientist, so I can't really speak to whether this will be all I need, but it was certainly helpful in the data science concepts I'be been exposed to so far.",1019,"math"
"5845","5845","By Mahnaz K",5,"Oct 22, 2019","The course overall was great. So much math was covered that it is hard to believe it was all done in 4-5 weeks required to complete the course. It was well taught-- very relevant and clear for the most part. I have had all this math in the past so I had a frame of reference but without it I think it would be hard to follow.  Having said that,  I found the Probability lectures hard to follow. It seemed you need to know a lot of probability theory beforehand. Also the videos were too short in this sections and went very fast.  The videos need to be 20-25 minutes with more examples.  The quizzes in this section were the hardest because not many examples were given in the lecture.  Overall though I feel accomplished and feel I can tackle the math that comes my way when I pursue my data science degree.  Thank you for putting together a course with the background math needed for data science.",900,"math"

This course is a particularly good option for individuals who have seen some amount of calculus and algebra but haven't used those methods in a long while and need to review. Thorough, easy-to-understand material.I would suggest to the course facilitators that they develop the provided lecture notes -- already a useful tool -- into a full-fledged text. I'm not suggesting something much longer than what they already have, but simply taking that document and adding a bit more rich content. While the notes are useful for more carefully studying the math being done in the lectures, even a bit of effort putting some pedagogy into the notes and combining them into a single document (which I did for the sake of printing) would create a hugely valuable resource.",836,"math"
"5847","5847","By Kostas H",5,"Mar 09, 2018","This course is designed for those either without a college level math background (calculus, probability, etc) and thus need an introduction to fundamental math skills or for those who need a refresher. This is not a course that teaches data science, nor the math of data science (linear algebra, random processes, algorithms, etc). But rather it teaches the math behind the math of data science. It reviews the basics of sets, plotting, sigma notation, derivatives, logarithms, mean and variance, Bayes theorem, etc. It is a gentle introduction to basic math skills that everyone should have. This is a course to definitely take as a refresher or before venturing into more higher topics such as collegiate math, data analysis, machine learning, computer science, engineering, etc.",782,"math"
"5848","5848","By Mariana E",5,"Apr 08, 2018","Este curso lo recomiendo mucho a quienes estén interesados en refrescar sus conocimientos de matemáticas para pasar a cursos de estadística o data science. Es muy compacto por lo que los temas se tratan de manera concisa, pero realmente se avanza si se invierte el tiempo necesario. Yo estoy interesada en la estadística y mi campo es la lingüística, así que me tocó trabajar muchas horas haciendo cuentas en el papel y en la calculadora, buscando cómo hacer para sacar las distribuciones binomiales y las funciones básicas, pero me pareció al final que he dado grandes avances, me encantan las matemáticas.",607,"math"

It would be much better if it had more of the same, which is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5. In my opinion, it is too brief; I hope to see a part 2 expanding on the material provided here. Many of the topics mentioned, and they really were mentioned more than really taught, should have been talked about in more detail. I've completed the whole course in about 4-6 hours over 2.5 days. It is a good attempt, but it is hardly a sufficient preparation for the field of Data Science; students looking to take the course should be aware of this.TLDR: A nice and brief overview of many important concepts (sadly, missing linear algebra) which lay the mathematical foundation for getting into Data Science. Needs to be expanded upon.",906,"math"

I would also wish for a finals test that integrates many of the newly acquired skills, rather than have them isolated.",398,"math"
"6101","6101","By Colin P",4,"Mar 28, 2018","Good refresher course on introductory math concepts relevant to data science (I hope!).

"6102","6102","By Katya K",4,"Nov 11, 2019","the first few lectures, first half is really easy to follow, quizzes are a great way of firming up the new knowledge.

"6246","6246","By Susmito R",3,"Jul 13, 2019","The first two weeks of the course were great! The instructor was very clear in his explanations and made the material very intuitive. The video companion pdf's were also very well written. But from the third week onward, when the other instructor took over, not only did the explanations suffer significantly, the video companion material also ceased to be of much help. He did not explain any of the intuition behind any of the formulas and he didn't even try to explain the intuition behind when and where the formulas would apply. I didn't take this course just to be given a bunch of formulas. I really wanted to understand the material because I knew these are foundational concepts that needed to be mastered. Khan Academy explains a lot of the material of weeks 3 and 4 much better. I really wish someone had explained how the version of the binomial theorem that was presented in this course is related to the traditional version that we learned in school while doing binomial expansions in algebra.",1007,"math"
"6247","6247","By Brendan S",3,"May 06, 2017","I definitely learned a lot in this course, and, as someone who has historically avoided mathematics, I think it is a fairly good introduction to these concepts for people at my level.  However, I think the course was somewhat inconsistent.  The final module could really use some more explanation and examples.  Probability is a very abstract field, and it can be difficult to take real world examples and translate them into formulas.  I think that the module would benefit greatly from spending some extra time on translating english-language situations into formulas.  There were also some non-trivial errors in the videos that need to be corrected.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with the course but I think it doesn't yet fill out its potential.",746,"math"
"6248","6248","By Allen F",3,"Oct 05, 2019","The first part of this course was great. It was the right level of material, taught simply and effectively with quizzes and exams that were on par with the taught material. The second half was not so great. The teaching style of the second teacher did not convey the material as effectively as the first teacher. Also, I felt that the week 4 probability quiz and final exam had material way beyond what was taught during the lesson. There should have been some exercises to warm us up and get us to the difficulty level of the final. It felt like going from 0-100 mph.

When it comes to statistics, fewer concepts introduced per video, and more examples of each concepts would have been a better approach for real beginners.Finally, don't believe you've acquired the ""math skills"" necessary for data science just by following this course.

real world applications (the most enjoyable part for me), which also were very interesting and were the main reason the course got me hooked. To be honest, I had already taken a probability course many years ago but this was definitely
 better. Now I realize I hadn´t fully understood key concepts until now

I would love to see more in the way of rigorous exams and projects. But I suppose that's what more advanced courses are for!

By reading a long queue of numbers from slides for 10min, the student can't follow at all. This is not a simple presentation, this is math topics. You  can't just pass a slide full of numbers and some sentences thinking that the student can comprehend all that stuff.On the other hand, on the 3rd party quizzes has been made a magnificent job.",675,"math"

This course goes straight into my top 10 all time favorite courses list, and is definitely the one I enjoyed the most in 2017. The course helped me understand how societies and economies have evolved over the years, which is a prerequisite for appreciating the basis on which modern societies are built on. The course is delivering by a prominent academic who knows what he's talking about. There is a good flow from lecture to lecture and the presenter makes a solid effort to presents facts, rather than his own (or others') judgements.All in all, I felt this is a great, eye-opening and thought provoking course, and I'd recommend everybody with an interest in politics, society and modern history to give it a shot.",1045,"hist"
"6667","6667","By jorge e j d",5,"Dec 29, 2017","An excellent synthesis of history. The teacher explains the topics very well and is entertaining. As a Latin American, I miss that nothing is mentioned about the history of independence and Spanish power at that time. It is logical that there are always topics left. Although the English and Americans have built the world since 1700, there are good stories from the Latin American side. No mention was made of the great inflation unleashed in Europe by Spanish gold. It would also be interesting to include the big scams that happened and some characters in France, who shaped capitalism. You could go deeper into banking and other characters like Robert Owen who I think was the first true socialist. But as I said the subject is extensive and I learned a lot. I am a 53 year old Colombian who studied by general culture. Convey the most sincere congratulations and thanks to the professor. A hug. Una excelente síntesis de la historia . El profesor explica muy bien los temas y es entretenido. Como latinoamericano extrañe que no se menciona nada de la historia de la independencia y del poderío español en esa época. Es lógico que siempre se quedan temas. si bien los ingleses y los norteamericanos han construido el mundo desde 1700 hay buenos relatos  del lado latinoamericano. No se menciono nada de la gran inflación que se desató en Europa por el oro Español. Seria interesante también incluir las grandes estafas que ocurrieron y algunos personajes  en Francia, que moldearon el capitalismo. Se podría profundizar en la banca y en otros personajes como Robert Owen que creo que fue el primer verdadero socialista. Pero como dije el tema es extenso y aprendí mucho.

It's amazing how much my perspective on history and studying history has changed over a half century.It might be helpful for a student to have had some exposure to European and American history prior to taking this two-course sequence. A knowledge of world geography would also be beneficial. The quizzes in part 2 seemed to cover more material than the quizzes in part 1, which required me to change my study habits a bit.

Its professor is a very learned and notable figure in both American Academia and Politic having lead the 9/11 commission but refusing to sanction the doctrine of pre-emptive strike. Frankly if they'd have taken his course, they'd have known why.

Only cavil is that one or two lectures are perhaps a touch too compressed, even for such a brief course (week three, for example).

The split between the ''what'' and the ''why'' is about 50/50 which I find quite rare as many of my previous learning experiences concentrated primarily on the ''what'' which is not enough to truly understand life and the world.

to E.Ouaedackers 
Dear Dr. Quaedackers,
                I have just finished the Coursera course, Big History:  From the Big Bang until Today, and found it a very worthwhile experience.  If you can bear with me, I have a few (hopefully) helpful comments; if not please metaphorically shred this email and place in the bottom of your canary cage.  The canary is optional.
The course was well organized both per presentation and per weekly topic, and the tempo of the course was appropriate.  Having a transcribed text to accompany each presentation was quite helpful, although at times, due to the text being voice-prompted, the accents of the various speakers produced unique spellings, initially difficult to recognize as English.  [Please note that were the arrangement reversed and, say, my American English accent were to be voice-morphed into Dutch spelling, who knows what would be produced!  So, this last is not a criticism but rather an observation.]  In particular, I found the combination of both a narrative approach to Big History and a conceptual one, the concepts being embedded within the overall narrative, a very effective mode of presentation, especially with the ultimate expectation of students producing a Little Big History on some personally valued topic. 
With regard to the presenters themselves, all come off as experts who are genuinely motivated by the nature of their fields of study and by their responsibility to present in your course.  While I did not complete a head-count of the total number of presenters, it was certainly in double digits and possibly in the twenties; what a nightmare to schedule and organize!  My hat is off to you and your staff on this last point.  While time per presentation is of the essence and the focus of the course was well established, it would have been interesting to have each presenter, either as a portion of their presentation or as a text addendum to the presentation, comment on the perspective that Big History gives to their specific research.  Moving on…….
My formal training is in biology and at the graduate level, zoology with emphasis in ecology and evolution.  This last is mentioned so you can take what follows with a grain of salt, i.e. my comments are biased by my background and are unnecessarily ladened with expectation.  It would have been nice if the portion of the course dealing with the history of life spent a bit more time on mechanisms, specifically with respect to recovery from mass extinctions, and it would have been equally nice if comparisons of evolved complexity of succeeding ecologies were made between mass extinctions.  Penultimately, after the Permo-Triassic extinction Lystrosaurus is the only large terrestrial vertebrate to appear in the fossil record.  This poses some interesting ecological problems with respect to food source, predators, pathogens, and biomass, perhaps worth some consideration in a future version of the course.  [Note here that Wignall (2015) suggests a slough of extinctions occurring over 80 million years beginning just prior to the P-T boundary and extending to the end of the Triassic and into the early Jurassic.  Also note that Wignall suggests that biomass recovers quite quickly while biodiversity requires significantly more time to recover.  If correct, this is an interesting phenomenon associated with recovery from collapse of complex systems in general!]  Finally, convergent evolution should be considered more thoroughly both in temporal sequence, e.g. Phytosaurs to Crocodilians and with respect to the convergence of adaptive radiations themselves, e.g. Marsupials v. Placentals.
In closing, your course is excellent, and I would recommend it without qualification to anyone wishing a broader perspective of who we are, where we’ve been, and where we’re going.  In conjuction with your course, I purchased Prof. Spier’s Big History and the Future of Humanity and found it a very worthwhile companion. The assigned writings were excellent and the capstone project very effective.  Well done here!  I do however have some concerns regarding the use of multiple choice questions, particularly when the payoff for being “correct” is so heavily skewed toward making errors; reward for learning should not be so constrained.  Also, the position of Big History within formal academics, something that is currently only now being established, might be a valuable discussion topic to consider in the future.  Further, asking students to submit their own unanswered Big History questions at the end of the course might be enlightening to both the student population and the presenters.  Beyond these few admittedly narrow concerns and as mentioned previously, this course is excellent.
Many, many thanks for a first rate educational experience,

Tony Harper

It took a video or two for me to get used to seeing the professor talk to the camera, but once I got used to that, I really began to enjoy Dr. Kenez's style. He managed to cover a lot of history while still giving enough details to help student understand why events occurred as they did. Also, I like the fact that he told you when he offered an opinion. More than once, he said, ""In my opinion"" or ""I believe"" rather than presenting his opinion as a fact. If he had another course, I would take it because he did such a great job. I don't need the certificate but have decided to pay for this course as I think it's only fair to pay for such a valuable product. Thank you, Dr. Kenez.",711,"hist"

very much Professor Peter Kenez for the instructive and interesting course
which I have almost finished only the essay and reviewing peers are remaining.
I wish I had been taught the history of Russia up till the time of me going to primary
school when I was young.Indeed, the
Russian people have suffered a lot and it is no wonder that they see Putin as
their rescuer, whether he really is there rescuer will be shown in the future.
I am not very optimistic.On the
other hand, the communist system which created shortages asked for corruption
and I think that not one Russian has not misused the system in the past, it has
become part of life. That a few people, the oligarchs exploited the new
situation is in no way defendable but was the outcome of a rotten system.What I
missed in the course is any talk about the Vory, the Russian mafia which was
there even in Stalin’s period and which is at the moment in command in Russia
according to the book” The Vory” from Mark Galeotti. Especially in the lesson
“Shock therapy” I think the Vory should have been mentioned because of the
crimes they committed during that time.",1133,"hist"

be compulsory in High School (racism and antisemitism are rampant

Mankind a killing machine so well planned and so supported by the common
population that brought millions of men, women, and children to die in gas
chambers like in the Holocaust. The Holocaust is an event that has no precedent
in History. The genocide was not carried our for reason of territory or even

Christian antisemitism, racial antisemitism, ""conspiracy-paranoia""
antisemitism, and redemptive antisemitism). Yehuda Bauer writes: ""The

for hatred of foreigners, and, of course, for antisemitism”, pp. x–xi / “I

catastrophe in human civilization. It happened because it could happen; if it
could not have happened, it would not have done so. And because it happened

Up until now i had been self educating myself by reading various books, publications, watching videos etc. However the system did not look very cohesively. The information i was getting was in a disorganised fashion. Then i came across this course and knew i had to take it. And for the first time since i have strived to know more about this subject was i able to get information in a well-integrated and structured format. The course starts exactly from a point and time in history which is relevant to studying the holocaust. The course was immensely eye opening and the content truly compelling.

The topic sequence was logical and led me from the rise of Hitler to the preparation for his final solution.  I have read a small number of books on the Holocaust but I found much information that I didn't know I didn't know.  I am enrolled in Part II and looking forward to the class.

I am very thankful for the disciplined methodology of analysis and understanding that the historians from the University of Tel Aviv demonstrated in this course.

Aunque deja varios temas al aire (dada la brevedad del curso) como las civilizaciones pre-helénicas Ahrede, es una excelente introducción al mundo griego. También resulta de utilidad para los que ya están familiarizados con la historia de Grecia antigua, ya que ofrece interpretaciones y discusiones actualmente vigentes en la historiografía. Agradezco también a Coursera por hacer posible que expertos en temas que poco o nada se tocan en algunos países (México en mi caso) estén al alcance de quienes estamos interesados en formarnos de manera académica en la Historia antigua.",776,"hist"

Worst part for me is that you can only get a certificate if you agree to verified certificates which means giving coursera access to your webcam and also allowing them to save your typing patterns with to me I don't mind paying something for the courses, but will not use verified certificates as I have no need for their verification, and will only take on demand classes that use this format if they have content i really want.",775,"hist"

On top of the basic history, I appreciated the comments on the research method, the nuances in the interpretation of different events, the presentation of additional elements (e.g., pictures, maps, artifacts) to support the lectures, etc. I was sometimes rushing a bit to go through all the reading assignments but I'm glad to know now what to read and where to search to get more information on the topic.

His understanding of the topic was excellent and his ability to communicate such a tremendous span of critical Western history efficiently and in an organized manner made the course valuable to me.

Prof. Andrew Szegedy-Maszak demonstrates great knowledge about the subjects, covering literature, government, and philosophy.Yet the course has two setbacks: 1) The professor stutters through the lectures, displaying his obvious discomfort being on camera; and 2) the overview is very expansive, so there isn't great  study in any single theater of Greek civilization.There is, however, solid coverage. I also felt the chapter on the 4th cent. BC, done to address complaints about no coverage of Alexander and Macedon, feels tacked on.  It's a long, but somehow hurried lecture.
That said, I liked this course. I gained greater knowledge of important political and literary figures, such as Solon and Alcibiades, than I did when I studied the subject back in college.",935,"hist"

"7624","7624","By Genevieve S",5,"May 26, 2017","This is a wonderful way to familiarize yourself with Ancient Egypt. It covers the basics on the Pre- Dynastic Period, the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms, and the Late Period. Professor Silverman is clearly someone who truly enjoys teaching others about this subject, and his lectures are very interesting. The Forums are really useful, too, as they provide a wealth of extra information which can be learned from discussions with other students. If you have any interest in archeology, Ancient Egypt, or the birth of civilization, you should definitely take this course, and I sincerely hope Professor Silverman come out with more courses to expand on this fascinating subject! The only thing that could make this better would be some peer-reviewed assignments, as I find that assigned essays, etc., help me assimilate the information more fully, and having them reviewed by others ensures that I have understood what I learned correctly.",938,"hist"
"7625","7625","By Beka K",5,"Aug 09, 2017","It would have been better if the quizzes were more adapted to the content of the text. However, it is quite informative and spectacular course with many pictures of the different Egyptian items, pyramids, pharaohs, etc. And what is the most important to me, after finalizing the course, a desire appeared in my mind to watch some fiction films about ancient Egypt. I advise you, guys to watch the following fiction films after the course end: 1) The Mummy (1999); 2) The Mummy Returns (2001); and 3) The Scorpion King (2002). There you will find out and discover many things, items and bulletins, that are mentioned in the given course. They are partly horror genre, but it is worth to watch.",692,"hist"
"7626","7626","By Noorali H",5,"Jan 10, 2018","I hope to pursue religious studies. I had some idea that I would have to review Egyptian religions to see how later antiquity developed, such as Hellenistic and Islamic cosmologies. But I had no idea how highly evolved the Egyptians were so early on. Their architecture is technologically mind boggling and hard to explain in detail. But their cosmologies are highly understandable from later cosmologies such as found in Mahabharata and Ramayana of India. This series of lectures did do justice to spiritual concepts. It would take a PhD level of effort to develop some of these themes. No words to thank Professor Silverman and U Penn. I wish I was a graduate student there.",676,"hist"
"7627","7627","By Syed H A",5,"May 27, 2018","I think its the best online course I have taken anywhere about history of ancient Egypt. I was also inspired by the way Dr David P.

The lessons mentioned in the ""further reading"" section of every week were carefully picked so as to give the reader a whole recap as well as further insight to what was learned during that week.

"7857","7857","By Susan E B",4,"Oct 22, 2017","As I was going through the course, it struck me that I was hearing almost the same thing I studied in my courses in the early 1970's in which the material for the sphinx and Giza pyramids was based on  determinations by ""scholars"" from the 1880's and early 1900's.  I was also surprised that no consideration was given for more recent re-interpretations of the timeframe for the sphinx, in view of studies done on the possible water erosion, possible reshaping of the head and so on.  To me, these theories are worth mentioning as possibilities; thus, I felt some disappointment.   Nevertheless, I enjoyed the course overall and enjoyed seeing so many different artifacts that helped define different eras in the history of Egypt. I also enjoyed learning about the dig in which the university is involved.  Thanks!",814,"hist"
"7858","7858","By Kate G",4,"Jan 06, 2017","The course is a good general knowledge introduction to Egypt, there is lots of information stuffed into each week. The lecturer's style is super dry, but the lectures are ultimately very useful. This course style is sometimes a bit disconnected, in that the information you are given is often handled purely as information, and not quite as often contextualized. This tends to make the quizzes, and discussion prompts feel disjointed, and challenging in the way that it's difficult to use your newfound knowledge in application. That being said, I really enjoyed the class as a very direct knowledge-gathering experience.",621,"hist"
"7859","7859","By Toni M",4,"Oct 15, 2017","Good information, organized in an interesting and unique way. The graphics and labeling are beautiful.The course is flawed, however, by the way the professor is obviously reading a script from a teleprompter. His delivery is uncomfortably slow. and. Awkward. withunatural. pauses. In. hisspeech. I wish he would just talk! He seems knowledgeable but his passion for the the subject is ruined by the stilted speech. My favorite video was the last one, where he and a lab technician are in a restoration lab, and the two of them are just talking. If the entire course had been that way, it would be a 5-star winner.",613,"hist"
"7860","7860","By Valentin P",4,"Nov 15, 2016","I did learn a few new things, but I would have to say the course is very easy to pass.  The hardest part is the essay questions, but these are optional.  Anyone having basic knowledge of Egyptian history could pass all the quizzes without doing anything else.  You only have to get 50% correct.The recorded lectures were good, but not great.  The speaker is reading the transcript and it seems like for the first time.  He is not speaking naturally and it's a bit stiff.Nevertheless, for someone just starting, the course has all the essential information needed and you will learn a lot.",588,"hist"
"7861","7861","By Mitchel W",4,"Jun 23, 2017","
Course was intresting, material was explained in a way that most people 
would have understood it. Even without a degree in history or anything 
like that. However David P Silverman is not a person to be put in front of a camera. He doesn't look at the camera and I think this is caused because most of the time he is reading of what he wants to say. Apart from that he speaks in one tone all the time wich in due time gets quit boring. Try to sound more entheusiastic. I know he probarbly is, it just doesn't show on camera.",527,"hist"
"7862","7862","By Paraskevi G",4,"Nov 09, 2017","Very interesting course that doesn't require the learner to have any 
knowledge on ancient Egypt. Regardless,
 it is also interesting for people involved in Archaeology (especially 
beginners who may not have had much contact with the area yet) since it 
provides interesting and accessible information. The lector is easy to comprehend, very 
knowledgeable and shows many examples but it is obvious that he reads his speech from a screen in front of him and that makes his lectures rather stiff and less enthusiastic.",519,"hist"
"7863","7863","By Jill R",4,"Sep 02, 2019","It was an interesting course, the lectures were kind of dry but the information delivered was worth sitting through them for not to mention the artifacts themselves, always moving to see them. The quizzes could have been better as some of the questions could be ambiguous or referenced material that wasn't discussed, some may have had more than one correct answer depending on which archaeologist one decided to stand with. Overall, I enjoyed it and plan on taking the next installment, Wonders of Ancient Egypt.",515,"hist"
"7864","7864","By Catherine",4,"Feb 03, 2020","Although I enjoyed the course, I am dismayed at the number of spelling errors in the transcript for all weeks. I believe a voice recognition program was used but it seems no one reviewed the final transcript before posting. Faïence was a common mis-spelling. If I could download the entire transcript for each week (I could only find the transcript available by segment) I would be glad to note errors so they can be corrected.",427,"hist"
"7865","7865","By Jay  G",4,"Nov 13, 2017","Great course. I wish it demonstrated more of the Nubian culture of Egypt as well. One of the last videos, was disappointing to see a clearly black Mummy whose name was Pontious (sp) which means Black or Nubian, and the narrator made a disclaimer on it. Also, the narrator appeared as if he was frightened and reading from a script the entire time. Sort of took away from the lecture. Other than that it was a good class.",421,"hist"
"7866","7866","By Tom L",4,"Nov 14, 2017","Informative for the beginner but Dr Silverman really does have to work on his deadpan delivery as the excitement of the teacher spreads to the student. The only time he cracked a smile was when he was talking in the lab. There was little personal insight into the life of the ancient Egyptians and many points were raised with an ""I will come back to that"" which never seemed to materialize.",391,"hist"
"7867","7867","By Cynthia M K",4,"Feb 03, 2020","Adorei fazer esse curso e aprendi muito. No entanto, tenho algumas críticas a fazer. O curso é um pouco cansativo porque o narrador fala, masas imagens não são muito explicativas. As provas pedem detalhes que muitas vezes são totalmente desimportantes. O texto em português precisa urgentemente de uma revisão, tanto da grafia como do conteúdo. Tem horas que o texto em português atrapalha.",390,"hist"
"7868","7868","By Harry F",4,"Nov 07, 2016","The course was interesting and contained a lot of information.  However, the quiz questions are not all answered in the lectures.

Or more easily, rewrite the quizzes to contain only lecture material.",381,"hist"

"7870","7870","By Christian C",4,"Apr 24, 2018","Overall great intro slash brief overview of Ancient Egypt.

I am glad to have it as a resource while I am dabbling in Egyptology these days.  Finished the course in less than a week.It should be noted that, for the most part, this is a series of short 2-6 minute lectures delivered in ""talking head"" style with what has been called ""negative stage presence"" doing ""stand and deliver"" lectures read from a prompter of some kind.  There is a good attempt at production quality in the video lectures.The least enjoyable part are the accompanying lecture notes presented as "".txt"" files filled with grammar, syntax and typo errors.  Printed them out and read them all.  ""Ray"" is not the spelling of either Re or Ra but it's in there.  These need a complete proofreading.The quizzes are problematic at times.  I will mention only the quiz at the end of ""Mummies and Mummification:"" where there is a question regarding how the heart was handled during the mummification process.  From the lecture and the lecture notes: ""It was either left in place or removed, mummified, and then replaced in the body.""  This means it is an either/or but only one of these will be marked correct.  I would like my quiz corrected.Overall, I got what I came for - a fairly comprehensive overview and introduction to ancient Egypt and Its Civilization.  I learned new facts, gained new insights and picked up some heretofore unknown subtleties.  I enjoyed it but had to work through some unnecessary pedagogy.  Glad I did it.  Took about 10 hours as advertised.  Evidently there is a follow up course but I will not be going forward with it.  I appreciated this introductory course for what it is.",1755,"hist"
"7931","7931","By G R C",3,"Jun 27, 2017","The material in this course is of a high standard as one would expect. However, the presentation leaves much to be desired. The video transcripts need to be proofread and corrected and at least one is missing.  Where errors in videos have been made, or material changed for other reasons, the video 'drop ins' are clumsy. This is only presentational, but it matters. More seriously, questions in the quiz sometimes refer to subjects that have not been taught in the lectures and don't even feature in the suggested background reading material. Some  participants would find this quite disheartening . Finally, while Dr Silverman is, clearly, an eminent academic, he is not a natural presenter, reading from a script and uncomfortable on camera. Overall, while the content is very interesting, the course could do with a makeover.",830,"hist"
"7932","7932","By Max B",3,"Dec 16, 2016","The course was extremely easy. I hoped it would be more of a challenge. No homework, only a 10 questions test every week (that is also extremely easy). As someone who's always been interested in Ancient Egypt, I already knew some things and ended up being able to pass the tests with 90-100% without even following the course. It's really an introduction for people who are pretty much new to the subject, so I'd recommend it, but for people who are looking for something more, you might find it boring. Even though the teacher is nice, the description of the course made me hope that it would be more interesting visually. I mostly read the transcriptions instead of watching the videos, because the teacher would just stand there and talk without moving, and it was not stimulating to me.",790,"hist"
"7933","7933","By Isabella",3,"Nov 06, 2016","The subject is interesting, but the presentation is dry, boring, in monotonous tone. Feels like somebody is reading a text book.

It is unfortunate, because I was eagerly waiting for the course.",362,"hist"

The lectures were monotonous and stiff, I found myself watching the videos on mute with the subtitles on! (p.s. the persons who transcribed the videos should have taken the time to see and hear what they were translating since there are quite a few errors on names, locations, even simple words). I also found the lessons rather superficial, did not ""dive"" into the heart of this great civilization. Finally, having read a book or two on the subject, the whole experience added almost nothing to my previous knowledge on ancient Egypt.

"7947","7947","By Mildred D B",2,"Jan 11, 2017","The subject matter is of great interest to me but unfortunately Dr. Silverman standing paralyzed before a projected backdrop and lecturing in a monotone doesn't do it.  Too much ""talking head"" (actually motionless body) and too few visuals of course material.  I'm sure he's a brilliant man, but an adequate lecturer he is not.  If he's so shy he might just do voice-overs.  I have dropped the course and will just read the book.  I would not, incidentally, rate the course at an intermediate level.  Beginning would be more accurate.Onscreen videos are bad enough, being at one remove from the classroom, but onscreen videos of an immobile monotone lecturers will kill any subject.",682,"hist"

There is no excitement in him to make me want to be excited to learn anything new. There are breaks in his speaking as if he is waiting for the prompter to move to the next page. All he does is stand and never moves, very boring and very dry.Some of the later lessons were a bit better.

"7984","7984","By Yannis R",2,"Mar 18, 2018","A lot of the material felt like little more than a bombardment of names. The first assignment was awful, there was no way to infer what was required from us from the assignment's description. People have been saying this for over a year, yet there was no attempt to fix the assignment. Quite a few of the videos were of very poor quality. The sand video in the Geomancy module, for example, was amongst the worst I've seen on Coursera.",436,"hist"
"7985","7985","By Brett B",3,"Jun 05, 2019","Very informative and helpful in understanding some of the unexplained areas of Anthropology.  However there are too many videos (which can be hard for the hearing impaired considering the accompanying text is in need of improvement), not enough faculty and instructor support and the syllabus is in need of detail and structure.",330,"hist"
"7986","7986","By Daniela G",5,"Jun 21, 2019","A pretty intereseing course. Personally I liked it and it shed some light on the concept of Magic, Sorcery, Witchcraft, and the implications of the church or the views of the church on it. It does take a political turn. The concept pretty much was, if a child was ill, he/she was better left to die, to try to heal/treat the child via magic methods. Interesting. I can see the Biblical implications, however, with the arival of the inquisitors (which were leading some kind of rituals in secret) under the supervision of the Pope... This part is shows the political implications. Apparently, there was nu jurisdiction that these inquisitors had, therefore, it was a matter of beliefs in the end. Believing in God, vs. Witchcraft. So the freedom of religion in a way is not necessarily existant since persecution takes place. Interesting course. I would recommend it if you want to learn more about Magic and the arrival or the notion of such.",943,"hist"
"7987","7987","By Catherine H B",5,"Apr 07, 2019","I learnt a lot from this module. The lessons are incredibly interesting especially for those who are interested in the Medieval Ages and the beliefs of the people back then",173,"hist"
"7988","7988","By James A H",5,"Dec 30, 2019","A fascinating look into magic in the Middle Ages, without it being a western-centric or judgemental way of examining the subject. The lecturers always maintained their descriptivist perspective, and succeeded in teaching a lot of different sections in a very short space of time. I particularly enjoyed the look into Astrology & geomancy, because with the current trends around popular astrology, it was fascinating to look into the history behind these practices. Magic in Islam, too, was a brilliant section. Many thanks to the university of Barcelona for offering the course.",578,"hist"
"7989","7989","By Olena Z",5,"Apr 28, 2019","Thank you for the course, it was interesting and exiting, and it's a pity it ended so quickly. On some topics I would like to get more information, and now I know in what direction to look and which sources to use.I would also like to see in the text under videos the time, when the illustrations are included in the video. Because my English level is not enough to understand all the lectors speech, I more read text under the video than watch the video itself. And I would like to know at what timestamp I can find the included illustration.",543,"hist"
"7990","7990","By Amy M",5,"Jun 26, 2017","I greatly appreciated the erudite content and approach of the lecture and the quality of links and supporting material. The lecturers were all outstanding. Since I am living in a country that seems to be embracing ignorance at warp speed, it was also refreshing and reassuring to hear the words of European scholars who value scholarship and critical thinking. This course has spurred my interest in the anthropological and historical examination of magic. I actually want to review the material of the course a second time! Thank you so much!",543,"hist"
"7991","7991","By Holly F",5,"May 20, 2019","A well-organized class that breaks down different attitudes of 'magic' throughout the Middle Ages- with emphasis on the clergy, as well as a unit specifically dedicated to Islamic Magic (which should be a course in itself as there was much to be covered). Much of what was covered was a reinforcement of what I have previously studied as someone who is interested in magic because of my background as an archaeologist and anthropologist- so this was a nice aspect. In sum, it was enjoyable.",490,"hist"
"7992","7992","By Laura O",5,"Oct 16, 2016","Outstanding quality of the professors, really pedagogically and atractive classes (not a display of presentations, this is eye-to-eye- kind of presence), comprehensive but extremelly compacted information, comprehensive bibliography that includes all the topic treated or barely mentioned. It's an enjoyable trip to the concept of magic and the social understanding of that word, in the Middle Ages throught the eyes of Catholic, Jewish and Astro-Scientists of the period.",474,"hist"
"7993","7993","By Pamela S",5,"Jun 14, 2017","There was a lot of information that was interesting to me, especially the lesson on Islamic Magic.  A new approach for me was using documents from the period to understand the cultural and societal context of the people for magic and superstitions.  The subtitles and printed transcript of the lectures came in handy if I had difficulty understanding the spoken word.  This was an enjoyable experience for me and I will refer to my notes in the future.",452,"hist"

"8155","8155","By Joseph V",4,"Jan 10, 2017","Not being an historian on the Middle Ages, Magic in the Middle Ages seems like an accurate and well planned course.  Week-4 and week-5 were the most interesting, with week-5 delving into the knitted relationship of magic in Islam, with roots and lineages directly connected to contemporary practices of  ""magic"" (which is something I did not know and was very curious about regarding the context of political and religious tensions evolving throughout the middle east).  I would have liked more activity-based and practical instructional units on how magic and rituals were conducted, especially information on healing, medicines, and alchemy.  Geomancy was the only practical component with explicit details on how to cast figures, and it needed to incorporate how it was used with astrology in a practical way.  A unit on Astrology and the Astrolabe was needed as well since the videos and literature often referred to astrology, and without a basic working and understanding of how an astrolabe was used to calculate a chart, the student is left hanging on having to figure way too much on their own (which becomes rife with problems and miscommunication).  The quizzes and assignments are fun but often awkwardly worded which became confusing, and can easily be cheated on.  Grading of assignments was a bit nebulous and put into question others abilities to accurately and fairly grade.  People paying money for course content should be separated from students not paying because engaging, stimulating, and critical analysis as discourse cannot be maintained in fidelity.  Of course, the credibility of ALL courses on Coursera are at stake because little to no universities and businesses accept the certificates as valid credentials for jobs or career ladder mobility.  Ultimately, one is paying for a piece of paper that is not really valued or even usable at the very same institutes that put together the coursework; and that is a very lame proposition!  The final kicker is that I needed to submit highly sensitive, personal identification just to get a PDF of the certificate--absolutely ridiculous, especially considering that the topic of interest for this course neither necessitates nor warrants such high-end secure methods.",2240,"hist"
"8156","8156","By Janet T",4,"Jun 18, 2019","I enjoyed
this course greatly and significantly expanded my knowledge of medieval times
and associated magic.  I particularly liked
that the course included the relationships of magic in Christian, Islamic and Jewish
religions.The
lectures were clear and focused and always accompanied by appropriate
literature ensuring that they were at the appropriate academic level.To help
with the continuous improvement of the course which you obviously undertake
regularly I make the following comments.It would be
useful to include specific clarification of the relationships between·       Miracles and magic.·       The Science of Letters and magic·       Geomancy and magicI always
like to have a rubric presented before I attempt an assessment. This helps you
to ensure that the assessment is on target.I have
certainly expanded my knowledge of this discipline and my experience with this
course encourages my to do other courses on history.",937,"hist"
"8157","8157","By Manuel M B",4,"Jan 28, 2018","Los profesores han demostrado una imparcialidad difícil de ver hoy en día en temas históricos y se han proporcionado muchas fuentes para ampliar información. La única crítica que hago es respecto de las tareas calificadas por compañeros. Las considero muy dirigidas en tanto que se espera una forma de responder muy concreta y, en mi opinión, va contra el sentido crítico independiente, además de que ser calificado por otras personas que son, al igual que uno mismo, alumnos, no me parece adecuado (""ciegos, guías de ciegos"") incluso dirigiendo la respuesta por parte del profesorado hacia puntos clave. Salvo eso, el resto perfecto y en balance general, muy recomendable.",673,"hist"

It contained a lot of detail without being overwhelming, and the lecturers were personable and informative in their delivery. It was also a good length and workload to commit to. My only small criticism would be that I would perhaps have preferred more of the essay and analysis based assessments, as the quizzes only required reiteration of the videos and I think that it would be more helpful to future historians to practice forming opinions and arguments. Apart from that, I have thoroughly enjoyed this MOOC and would definitely recommend.",648,"hist"

For example, the specifics of several charms/ingredients/etc are only treated on a few occasions.I have now also enrolled in different courses on Coursera and I can say that this course could have been organised better, with better assignments, quizzes, etc. So there is still room for improvement.",598,"hist"
"8161","8161","By Paraskevi G",4,"Nov 12, 2017","This course is very interesting and provides objective information and ""myth-busters"" that prove the difference between what we think of Magic in the Middle Ages and what was most probably the reality. The lectors are all very enthusiastic and it is refreshing to have many different people with different specializations than just one lector. What I didn't enjoy about this course was having to peer review my classmate's assignments; as I often tend to complete a whole course in a short time , this process slowed down my progress and I wasn't enjoying the course as much as I wished to.",590,"hist"

The only issue I had with this course was that peer-reviewed assignments (i.e. the written ones) were difficult, in that it was not always clear what was expected of the answers (namely that fairly specific things were required of the answers, whereas the questions seemed more open-ended).",543,"hist"

It seems thrown together without any attention to learning design and without clear learning outcomes and objectives. We were bombarded with names and facts without being offered any analysis, commentary or opportunities for critical reflection. The course was never tied to grander themes about history/humanity/ science or to contemporary events. The videos were almost completely devoid of visuals. Illuminated manuscripts and artworks could have been used to engage students’ visual senses. Week 4 was absolutely terrible. It was like watching a head read an encyclopedic entry. Why did we have to memorize the name Maslama Ibn Qāsim al-Qurṭubī, for instance? This is a serious question. My recommendation is to get an instructional designer or someone with pedagogical knowledge and expertise review the course and offer suggestions. It’s a shame that such an interesting topic was presented in such a terrible, mundane manner. I’d paid in advance for the certificate because I was very excited about the subject matter, but would have never gotten past Week 1 if I hadn’t made a financial commitment.",1150,"hist"
"8240","8240","By C. C",1,"Nov 30, 2016","While this course presents great content and valuable information, the caveat is in the overall experience. The moderators and instructors are nonexistent and cannot be reached. There is only one moderator who finally did his job and showed up to deal with some issues that many classmates were having (including myself), and even his response time is only once every week! So, he only started checking in once a week after I had already nearly completed the whole course. There are also some serious issues with glitches, technicalities and not being able to pass assignments and grade others' assignments. I completed this course a week ago, and many of my classmates are not able to complete it due to extreme glitches, like the system not taking in their projects and not even allowing them to move forward. It's such a shame. I'm the lucky one in that I was able to finish the course. The others? Not so lucky. They're still stuck back there and the staff of this course is really just not around and doesn't care!

Many of the lessons waste time gushing over what's coming next, but quite often the lesson itself feels weak and vague.

Regardless, I went ahead and finished the course, but I was also disturbed to see that some of the students did their assignments in a mockery fashion e.g. wrote song lyrics, or stated ""I don't know what else to say so I will tell you about my day..."" That was very irritating.  The class wasn't described clearly in the catalog, I thought it would be more of a history of the periods plus literature, but it wasn't exactly that...

"8319","8319","By eileen r",5,"Sep 24, 2016","This course is exceptional. in large part because Professor Struck  is thoroughly skilled, knowledgeable and enthusiastic in his lectures. From the first lecture, and consistently throughout the course, he imbues the material with both contemporary relevance and historical connections. He makes the student a part of the conversation, and always ties together concepts that in less skilled hands might seem disparate.  He lends his own intellectual brand of assocations to certain of the more complex ideas, thus rendering them accessible to learners who are new to the literature, history, ""litcrit"" and psychology of myth. Perhaps most important, Professor Struck's love of his subject(s) is infectious; though he does not appear to teach another Coursera course, I am sufficiently interested now, to take the other offering Greek history on Coursera. However, I wish that he were teaching a continuation of the class. As he said in the final lecture, we but skimmed the surface. It would be awesome if he could lead a more in-depth journey into the creations of these poets and their peers. I also appreciate the fact that Professor Struck recommended excellent editions of the texts. There are so many from which to choose; it was a gift to have his recommendation. I highly recommend this class. You will learn about myth - and you will learn about learning.",1364,"hist"

There is however a point which did not give satisfaction: as I am not a native speaker of English, I had to have constantly recourse to the transcriptions and they are appalling, at times incomprehensible. This detracted from the full enjoyment of an otherwise excellent course. I very much look forward to other courses from Professor Struck.

The instructor/lecturer makes a lot of grammar errors, mostly related to pronominal objects of prepositions.  It's distracting.  He also constantly characterizes the material under discussion as ""awful, nasty, horrible,"" and so forth.  I find it both a cop-out and offensive!  What are the materials aiming to communicate?  What is the instructor wanting to show us, beyond ""horrible and nasty""?  The somewhat superficial technique of asking us to consider ourselves as ancient Greeks and Romans fails utterly, since without a fair degree of learning that is not provided here and not possible, we are manifestly NOT ancients; it's misleading to imply we easily can be.

Existem várias teorias (muitas vezes conflitantes entre si) para explicar os mitos e seus fundamentos. Por ser complexo, cada teoria e cada parte da história são subdivididas em vários vídeos. Os temas são complexos e ao mesmo tempo fascinantes. A leitura antecipada dos livros indicados faz com que os vídeos sejam ainda melhores, pois muitas vezes jogam interpretações e análises que não conseguimos perceber ao lermos sozinhos. O contrário também é muito útil, principalmente com Virgílio: Assistir aos vídeos antes pode facilitar bastante a leitura desta obra complexa.

Prof. Struck of University of Pennsylvania clearly knows his subject well. He also brings his enthusiasm and his sense of excitement about ancient myths which make the lectures come alive. I have listened to recorded lecture series on mythology in the past as well as read several books on the subject, but I found this to be by far the most enjoyable.

The pictures, lectures, and discussions are devised to help the student gain a better understanding of the subject.

"8524","8524","By Christopher N",4,"May 27, 2016","The course was absolutely fantastic.  I apologize for giving it 4 stars; I feel that, to get that high a score, the course would need to have been constructing critical arguments rather than just observing those of others.  HOWEVER, I definitely improved the basis of my knowledge of mythology, which was my goal.  Professor Struck's presentation of the information was wonderful; he communicated a palpable enthusiasm in his subject, and had this wonderful habit of hilarious understatement: ""The most powerful piece of this episode is that Odysseus's men get turned into pigs. Now that's...terrible.""  I consistently laughed at these understated descriptions, and appreciated the contextual explanations that Professor Struck gave.  I would definitely take additional in-depth courses by Struck if they were to be offered in the future!",838,"hist"
"8525","8525","By Johnny L",4,"Feb 19, 2020","Great start of an entry level course. This is for noobies whom want to have general preview of the Ancient Greek and Roman mythologies. It covers a vast amount of Gods, Goddesses, creatures and legendary moral beings. I had hope it would give a deeper dive into the study of Ovid and Aeneid. However, it would probably lengthen the course into a Part 2 type of structure. I do hope more classes are offered to have a detailed review on the classics. I did study Homer back in College and we spent a semester each on Iliad and Odyssey. I felt there was not enough time to be spent on most of the books, however given the nature of the course and the depth for an introductory, it is understandable.A great companion piece on Amazon can be found - GREAT GREEK MYTHS. It is a two season long 25 min episodes on the same subjects.",827,"hist"
"8526","8526","By Gary",4,"Jan 11, 2019","I have been interested in Greek and Roman Mythology, but was only familiar with the intriguing stories and never realized that we could actually integrate different tools of analysis into our reading. The beginning lectures were easy as they start from well-known stories. As we continue, however, we should be very careful since we have to know different poets, some of whom are not so familiar. Anyway, this is the first course I select. I finished and benefited a lot.",472,"hist"
"8527","8527","By Irina",4,"Aug 13, 2016","The course is interesting, but Professor rhitoric skills are not good. He stumbles over his words, repeats his words, and doesn't have a structure of lessons, jumping from thought to thought. It's difficult to listen to him. Nevertheless, I like Professor's enthusiasm and I like Greek and Roman Mythology. Professor makes me look at the myths from a different point of view. It's amazing! I hope I will finish this course, which I took for my pleasure.",454,"hist"
"8528","8528","By Sindhura",4,"Aug 11, 2016","This course is a wonderful introduction to greek and roman mythology. I was always interested in knowing more about it, but didn't know where to start. The suggested reads in the course are a good starting point. I learnt a lot and got lots of pointers to read more. And most of the course was really fun.One suggestion I have though is to reduce the number of lectures, and make the content a bit more succinct.",413,"hist"
"8529","8529","By Jonathan G",4,"Feb 25, 2018","Interesting course. However, I don't believe it covers everything that needed to be  taught. You can easily read the Iliad and other ancient Greek books, but you don't need to be quizzed on it. It would make more sense if this course was about votive offerings and  polytheistic worship. Much like a world religions course! If it covered Olympianism and its practices it would've made more sense",396,"hist"
"8530","8530","By Alejandra C R",4,"Dec 03, 2016","Excellent course. The professor is a Master in the theme. He is also very communicative and funny! The problem is that the course is like a class, and online course should include more media resources available in order to be more ""interactive"". I confess that I already taken the first week. So, I hope that it will change.Thank you for letting me take this course, I am learning a lot!",387,"hist"
"8531","8531","By Ivelina M",4,"Mar 17, 2016","It requires some more time then other courses on the website. And it sometimes it's hard to follow the teacher on all videos (they are longish). But I like the subject a lot and it is nice to have it explained by someone who has a deep understanding of it. If you think the videos are too long, try increasing the playback speed. It worked for me!",348,"hist"
"8532","8532","By Evangelia B",4,"May 26, 2016","Nice course, just needs more video-included notes because we don't always watch the lectures online so that we can't always see the subtitles. And even if the changing questions when we retake the test are great cause they make us be more focused during the lecture, they were sometimes ""too much"".Really enjoyed this course, thank you.",336,"hist"
"8533","8533","By Sebastian H",4,"Jun 05, 2016","Quite interesting course, learned a lot about the motivations of the Greek and Roman poets, and their relations to myths.

"8534","8534","By erkin g",4,"Oct 11, 2019","I must say I have larned a lot through the course, but the lectures could be prepared more professionally.

"8535","8535","By morefreeze",4,"Apr 25, 2018","I am a learner from China. Maybe it's problem of subtitle, I think some course (like 10.8 The Fall of Troy and the Founding of Rome) main point is not very clear. It seems Professor Struck talked everyone but only few information about them.",242,"hist"
"8536","8536","By Syed H A",4,"Oct 15, 2018","I think its the best course to have an overview about Greek and Roman mythology, to know about important authors/ writers/ contributors & their famous characters around those mythic stories. Carefully designed to serve the purpose!",231,"hist"
"8537","8537","By Jiayang T",4,"Feb 02, 2018","The videos are interesting, but they are rather long each one comparing to other courses. Maybe the teacher can separate those long videos into short ones.",156,"hist"

"8558","8558","By Evelyn T",2,"Jan 31, 2020","The course started out really interesting and I felt like I was learning a lot. However, by the middle to end, the quality of the lectures started degrading-- I felt like the professor was talking in circles and at times I was unable to figure out what he was trying to say. Summarizing and taking notes became a lot harder. I'm not sure how much of this was due to the terrible quality of the transcript. There are literally parts that are annotated as [UNKNOWN] or [SOUND] mid-sentence. There is also a lot of grammatical error. Although much of the readings were not compulsory, there are test questions about the myth that you would only know from the reading and not from what's learned in the lecture. In this case, it would probably be better to just mark them as necessary so that everyone is on the same page.",819,"hist"
